    "abstract": "Individual differences in brain activity hinder the online application of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space. Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9% on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery. These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based P300 speller brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face three main challenges: low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor generalization, and time-consuming calibration. We propose SpellerSSL, a framework that combines self-supervised learning (SSL) with P300 aggregation to address these issues. First, we introduce an aggregation strategy to enhance SNR. Second, to achieve generalization in training, we employ a customized 1D U-Net backbone and pretrain the model on both cross-domain and in-domain EEG data. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned with a lightweight ERP-Head classifier for P300 detection, which adapts the learned representations to subject-specific data. Our evaluations on calibration time demonstrate that combining the aggregation strategy with SSL significantly reduces the calibration burden per subject and improves robustness across subjects. Experimental results show that SSL learns effective EEG representations in both in-domain and cross-domain, with in-domain achieving a state-of-the-art character recognition rate of 94% with only 7 repetitions and the highest information transfer rate (ITR) of 21.86 bits/min on the public II-B dataset. Moreover, in-domain SSL with P300 aggregation reduces the required calibration size by 60% while maintaining a comparable character recognition rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply SSL to P300 spellers, highlighting its potential to improve both efficiency and generalization in speller BCIs and paving the way toward an EEG foundation model for P300 speller BCIs.",

We introduce in this manuscript a mathematically rigorous framework that combines data-driven noise interval evaluation with advanced SNR visualization to address these limitations. Analysis of the publicly available Eye-BCI multimodal dataset demonstrates the method's ability to recover canonical P300 characteristics across frequency bands (delta: 0.5-4 Hz, theta: 4-7.5 Hz, broadband: 1-15 Hz), with precise spatiotemporal localization of both P3a (frontocentral) and P3b (parietal) subcomponents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess the impact of noise interval selection on EEG signal quality. Cross-session correlations for four different choices of noise intervals spanning from early to late pre-stimulus phases also indicate that alertness and task engagement states modulate noise interval sensitivity, suggesting broader applications for adaptive BCI systems. While validated in healthy participants, our results represent a first step towards providing clinicians with an interpretable tool for detecting neurophysiological abnormalities and provides quantifiable metrics for system optimization.",

    "abstract": "Effective control of neural interfaces is limited by poor signal quality. While neural network-based electroencephalography (EEG) denoising methods for electromyogenic (EMG) artifacts have improved in recent years, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models perform suboptimally in settings with high noise. To address the shortcomings of current machine learning (ML)-based denoising algorithms, we present a signal filtration algorithm driven by a new mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. Our algorithm leverages three new statistical insights into the EEG-EMG denoising problem: (1) EMG artifacts can be partitioned into quantifiable subtypes to aid downstream MoE classification, (2) local experts trained on narrower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges can achieve performance increases through specialization, and (3) correlation-based objective functions, in conjunction with rescaling algorithms, can enable faster convergence in a neural network-based denoising context. We empirically demonstrate these three insights into EMG artifact removal and use our findings to create a new downstream MoE denoising algorithm consisting of convolutional (CNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks. We tested all results on a major benchmark dataset (EEGdenoiseNet) collected from 67 subjects. We found that our MoE denoising model achieved competitive overall performance with SOTA ML denoising algorithms and superior lower bound performance in high noise settings. These preliminary results highlight the promise of our MoE framework for enabling advances in EMG artifact removal for EEG processing, especially in high noise settings. Further research and development will be necessary to assess our MoE framework on a wider range of real-world test cases and explore its downstream potential to unlock more effective neural interfaces.",

    "abstract": "In brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and P300 responses have achieved widespread implementation owing to their superior information transfer rates (ITR) and minimal training requirements. These neurophysiological signals have exhibited robust efficacy and versatility in external device control, demonstrating enhanced precision and scalability. However, conventional implementations predominantly utilise liquid crystal display (LCD)-based visual stimulation paradigms, which present limitations in practical deployment scenarios. This investigation presents the development and evaluation of a novel light-emitting diode (LED)-based dual stimulation apparatus designed to enhance SSVEP classification accuracy through the integration of both SSVEP and P300 paradigms. The system employs four distinct frequencies, 7 Hz, 8 Hz, 9 Hz, and 10 Hz, corresponding to forward, backward, right, and left directional controls, respectively. Oscilloscopic verification confirmed the precision of these stimulation frequencies. Real-time feature extraction was accomplished through the concurrent analysis of maximum Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) amplitude and P300 peak detection to ascertain user intent. Directional control was determined by the frequency exhibiting maximal amplitude characteristics. The visual stimulation hardware demonstrated minimal frequency deviation, with error differentials ranging from 0.15%to 0.20%across all frequencies. The implemented signal processing algorithm successfully discriminated all four stimulus frequencies whilst correlating them with their respective P300 event markers. Classification accuracy was evaluated based on correct task intention recognition. The proposed hybrid system achieved a mean classification accuracy of 86.25%, coupled with an average ITR of 42.08 bits per minute (bpm).",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) signal cleaning has long been a critical challenge in the research community. The presence of artifacts can significantly degrade EEG data quality, complicating analysis and potentially leading to erroneous interpretations. While various artifact rejection methods have been proposed, the gold standard remains manual visual inspection by human experts-a process that is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for large-scale EEG studies. Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong reliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato Field (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that addresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against several state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly available EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG recordings. Our results demonstrate that iRPF outperforms all competitors across multiple metrics, with gains of up to 22% in recall, 102% in specificity, 54% in precision, and 24% in F1-score, compared to Isolation Forest, Autoreject, Riemannian Potato, and Riemannian Potato Field, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these improvements (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) in most comparisons. Additionally, on a typical EEG recording iRPF performs artifact cleaning in under 8 milliseconds per epoch using a standard laptop, highlighting its efficiency for large-scale EEG data processing and real-time applications. iRPF offers a robust and data-driven artifact rejection solution for high-quality EEG pre-processing in brain-computer interfaces and clinical neuroimaging applications.",

These biologically grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor. Unlike prior work that encodes EMG into events, our method exploits spike timing on motor units to perform low-power, real-time inference. This is the first demonstration of motor neuron-based continuous regression computed directly on neuromorphic hardware.

In this paper, signal processing and quality of display of waveform at digital EEG machine were discussed to confirm its advantages and drawbacks. Signal processing on a digital EEG machine is summarized in 3 parts as follows: i) A/D conversion(sampling) of EEG signals in the head box, ii) Digital signal processing to obtain mathematically reconstructed EEG on the computer, iii) Displaying EEG on a monitor. For sampling, it was recommended that sampling rate was 200 or 256 Hz, and resolution in 12 bits or preferably 16 bits per sample. A high amplitude artifact caused EEG flattening called DC build up saturation. Montage reformatting had a clinical advantage. However, re-filtering using 15 Hz high cut filter influenced the EEG interpretation. The maximal resolution of digital EEG machine with a 17-inch CRT display using 1600 x 1200 dots was about 22 Hz. The performance of paper used for conventional EEG surpassed the performance of CRT display using digital EEG machine. It seemed that understanding the characteristics of digital EEG machine and realization of data processing were important for utilizing its functions effectively.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a noninvasive electrophysiological monitoring technique that records the electrical activities of the brain from the scalp using electrodes. EEG is not only an essential tool for diagnosing diseases and disorders affecting the brain, but also helps us to achieve a better understanding of brain's activities and structures. EEG recordings are weak, nonlinear, and nonstationary signals that contain various noise and artifacts. Therefore, for analyzing them, advanced signal processing techniques are required. Second order statistical features are usually sufficient for analyzing most basic signals. However, higher order statistical features possess characteristics that are missing in the second order; characteristics that can be highly beneficial for analysis of more complex signals, such as EEG. The primary goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive survey of the applications of higher order statistics or spectra (HOS) in EEG signal processing. Therefore, we start the survey with a summary of previous studies in EEG analysis followed by a brief mathematical description of HOS. Then, HOS related features and their applications in EEG analysis are presented. These applications are then grouped into three categories, each of which are further explored thoroughly with examples of prior studies. Finally, we provide some specific recommendations based on the literature survey and discuss possible future directions of this field.",

    "abstract": "When traditional EEG signals are collected based on the Nyquist theorem, long-time recordings of EEG signals will produce a large amount of data. At the same time, limited bandwidth, end-to-end delay, and memory space will bring great pressure on the effective transmission of data. The birth of compressed sensing alleviates this transmission pressure. However, using an iterative compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm for EEG signal reconstruction faces complex calculation problems and slow data processing speed, limiting the application of compressed sensing in EEG signal rapid monitoring systems. As such, this paper presents a non-iterative and fast algorithm for reconstructing EEG signals using compressed sensing and deep learning techniques. This algorithm uses the improved residual network model, extracts the feature information of the EEG signal by one-dimensional dilated convolution, directly learns the nonlinear mapping relationship between the measured value and the original signal, and can quickly and accurately reconstruct the EEG signal. The method proposed in this paper has been verified by simulation on the open BCI contest dataset. Overall, it is proved that the proposed method has higher reconstruction accuracy and faster reconstruction speed than the traditional CS reconstruction algorithm and the existing deep learning reconstruction algorithm. In addition, it can realize the rapid reconstruction of EEG signals.",

One method that has been gaining popularity in recent years is Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), which is highly effective in eliminating large amplitude and transient artifacts in EEG data. However, traditional ASR is not possible to use with single-channel EEG data. In this study, we propose incorporating signal decomposition techniques such as ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), wavelet transform (WT), and singular spectrum analysis (SSA) into ASR, to decompose single-channel data into multiple components. This allows the ASR process to be applied effectively to the data. Our results show that the proposed single-channel version of ASR outperforms its counterpart Independent Component Analysis (ICA) methods when tested on two open datasets. Our findings indicate that ASR has significant potential as a powerful tool for removing artifacts from EEG data analysis.Clinical Relevance- This provided artifact removal technique for single-channel EEG.",

We extract trends and highlight interesting approaches from this large body of literature to inform future research and formulate recommendations. To find relevant papers published in scientific journals, conferences, and electronic preprint repositories, researchers searched major databases covering the domains of science and engineering. For each investigation, many data items about (1) the data, (2) the channels used, (3) the extraction and classification procedure, and (4) the outcomes were extracted. These items were then analyzed one by one to uncover trends. Our analysis reveals that the amount of EEG data used across studies varies. We saw that more than half the studies used simulation driving experimental. About 21% of the studies used support vector machine (SVM), while 19% used convolutional neural networks (CNN). Overall, we can conclude that drowsiness and fatigue impair driving performance, resulting in drivers who are more exposed to risky situations.",

    "abstract": "Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.",

    "abstract": "For many years people have speculated that electroencephalographic activity or other electrophysiological measures of brain function might provide a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world - a brain-computer interface (BCI). Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or 'locked in', with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10-25bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.",

Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology, which facilitates direct communication between the brain and external devices, emerges as an innovative key to unlocking neurological conditions, demonstrating significant promise in this context. This comprehensive review uniquely synthesizes the latest advancements in BCI research across multiple neurological disorders, offering an interdisciplinary perspective on both clinical applications and emerging technologies. We explore the progress in BCI research and its applications in addressing various neurological conditions, with a particular focus on recent clinical studies and prospective developments. Initially, the review provides an up-to-date overview of BCI technology, encompassing its classification, operational principles, and prevalent paradigms. It then critically examines specific BCI applications in movement disorders, disorders of consciousness, cognitive and mental disorders, as well as sensory disorders, highlighting novel approaches and their potential impact on patient care. This review reveals emerging trends in BCI applications, such as the integration of artificial intelligence and the development of closed-loop systems, which represent significant advancements over previous technologies. The review concludes by discussing the prospects and directions of BCI technology, underscoring the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations. It emphasizes the importance of prioritizing bidirectional and high-performance BCIs, areas that have been underexplored in previous reviews. Additionally, we identify crucial gaps in current research, particularly in long-term clinical efficacy and the need for standardized protocols. The role of neurosurgery in spearheading the clinical translation of BCI research is highlighted. Our comprehensive analysis presents BCI technology as an innovative key to unlocking neurological disorders, offering a transformative approach to diagnosing, treating, and rehabilitating neurological conditions, with substantial potential to enhance patients' quality of life and advance the field of neurotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Advances in brain science and computer technology in the past decade have led to exciting developments in brain-computer interface (BCI), thereby making BCI a top research area in applied science. The renaissance of BCI opens new methods of neurorehabilitation for physically disabled people (e.g. paralyzed patients and amputees) and patients with brain injuries (e.g. stroke patients). Recent technological advances such as wireless recording, machine learning analysis, and real-time temporal resolution have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI approaches. Many BCI studies have focused on decoding EEG signals associated with whole-body kinematics/kinetics, motor imagery, and various senses. Thus, there is a need to understand the various experimental paradigms used in EEG-based BCI systems. Moreover, given that there are many available options, it is essential to choose the most appropriate BCI application to properly manipulate a neuroprosthetic or neurorehabilitation device. The current review evaluates EEG-based BCI paradigms regarding their advantages and disadvantages from a variety of perspectives. For each paradigm, various EEG decoding algorithms and classification methods are evaluated. The applications of these paradigms with targeted patients are summarized.

    "abstract": "This study explores neuroplasticity through the use of virtual reality (VR) and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections in response to learning, experience, and injury. VR offers a controlled environment to manipulate sensory inputs, while BCIs facilitate real-time monitoring and modulation of neural activity. By combining VR and BCI, researchers can stimulate specific brain regions, trigger neurochemical changes, and influence cognitive functions such as memory, perception, and motor skills. Key findings indicate that VR and BCI interventions are promising for rehabilitation therapies, treatment of phobias and anxiety disorders, and cognitive enhancement. Personalized VR experiences, adapted based on BCI feedback, enhance the efficacy of these interventions. This study underscores the potential for integrating VR and BCI technologies to understand and harness neuroplasticity for cognitive and therapeutic applications. The researchers utilized the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) method to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of the existing literature on neuroplasticity, VR, and BCI. This involved identifying relevant studies through database searches, screening for eligibility, and assessing the quality of the included studies. Data extraction focused on the effects of VR and BCI on neuroplasticity and cognitive functions. The PRISMA method ensured a rigorous and transparent approach to synthesizing evidence, allowing the researchers to draw robust conclusions about the potential of VR and BCI technologies in promoting neuroplasticity and cognitive enhancement.",

BCIs have the potential to improve the quality of life for many individuals affected by debilitating disorders of the brain, spine, limbs, and sensory organs through direct interface with the nervous system. While much progress has been made in terms of BCI motor control, significantly less attention has been given to the restoration of tactile, or cutaneous sensations, which can be very important during grasping or manipulation of objects. BCIs will need to integrate both the motor and sensory modalities to truly restore arm and hand function. Here we describe a bidirectional BCI, a system which translates neural signals recorded from the motor cortex into signals to control a device and provides somatosensory feedback by translating external sensor information to electric stimulation patterns delivered to the cortex. In this chapter, we review the neuroscience of somatosensation, the history of sensory feedback in BCI applications, specifically for restoration of hand function and cutaneous sensations, and describe additional work that needs to be completed to make bidirectional BCI a clinical reality.",

To date most applications have been demonstrations of proof-of-principle; widespread use by people who could benefit from this technology requires further development. Improvements in current EEG recording technology are needed. Better sensors would be easier to apply, more confortable for the user, and produce higher quality and more stable signals. Although considerable effort has been devoted to evaluating classifiers using public datasets, more attention to real-time signal processing issues and to optimizing the mutually adaptive interaction between the brain and the BCI are essential for improving BCI performance. Further development of applications is also needed, particularly applications of BCI technology to rehabilitation.

Studies conducted to provide knowledge about BCI-based intervention applications regarding memory, attention, visuospatial, learning, collaboration, and communication, social, creative and emotional skills are highlighted. Only non-invasive BCI type of applications are being investigated based upon representative, non-exhaustive and state-of-the-art studies within the field. This article examines the progress of BCI research so far, while different BCI paradigms are investigated.

BCI systems used for motor control record neural activity associated with thoughts, perceptions, and motor intent; decode brain signals into commands for output devices; and perform the user's intended action through an output device. BCI systems used for sensory augmentation transduce environmental stimuli into neural signals interpretable by the central nervous system. Both types of systems have potential for reducing disability by facilitating a user's interaction with the environment. Investigational BCI systems are being used in the rehabilitation setting both as neuroprostheses to replace lost function and as potential plasticity-enhancing therapy tools aimed at accelerating neurorecovery. Populations benefitting from motor and somatosensory BCI systems include those with spinal cord injury, motor neuron disease, limb amputation, and stroke. This article discusses the basic components of BCI for rehabilitation, including recording systems and locations, signal processing and translation algorithms, and external devices controlled through BCI commands.

    "abstract": "Advances in neural interfaces have demonstrated remarkable results in the direction of replacing and restoring lost sensorimotor function in human patients. Noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are popular due to considerable advantages including simplicity, safety, and low cost, while recent advances aim at improving past technological and neurophysiological limitations. Taking into account the neurophysiological alterations of disabled individuals, investigating brain connectivity features for implementation of BCI control holds special importance. Off-the-shelf BCI systems are based on fast, reproducible detection of mental activity and can be implemented in neurorobotic applications. Moreover, social Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is increasingly important in rehabilitation robotics development. In this paper, we present our progress and goals towards developing off-the-shelf BCI-controlled anthropomorphic robotic arms for assistive technologies and rehabilitation applications. We account for robotics development, BCI implementation, and qualitative assessment of HRI characteristics of the system. Furthermore, we present two illustrative experimental applications of the BCI-controlled arms, a study of motor imagery modalities on healthy individuals' BCI performance, and a pilot investigation on spinal cord injured patients' BCI control and brain connectivity. We discuss strengths and limitations of our design and propose further steps on development and neurophysiological study, including implementation of connectivity features as BCI modality.",

    "abstract": "Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that uses electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to control external devices, such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). Visual BCI paradigms based on P300 and Steady State Visually Evoked potentials (SSVEP) have shown high potential for clinical purposes. Numerous studies have been published on P300- and SSVEP-based non-invasive BCIs, but many of them present two shortcomings: (1) they are not aimed for motor rehabilitation applications, and (2) they do not report in detail the artificial intelligence (AI) methods used for classification, or their performance metrics. To address this gap, in this paper the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology was applied to prepare a systematic literature review (SLR). Papers older than 10 years, repeated or not related to a motor rehabilitation application, were excluded. Of all the studies, 51.02% referred to theoretical analysis of classification algorithms. Of the remaining, 28.48% were for spelling, 12.73% for diverse applications (control of wheelchair or home appliances), and only 7.77% were focused on motor rehabilitation. After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and quality screening was performed, 34 articles were selected. Of them, 26.47% used the P300 and 55.8% the SSVEP signal. Five applications categories were established: Rehabilitation Systems (17.64%), Virtual Reality environments (23.52%), FES (17.64%), Orthosis (29.41%), and Prosthesis (11.76%). Of all the works, only four performed tests with patients. The most reported machine learning (ML) algorithms used for classification were linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (48.64%) and support vector machine (16.21%), while only one study used a deep learning algorithm: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The reported accuracy ranged from 38.02 to 100%, and the Information Transfer Rate from 1.55 to 49.25 bits per minute. While LDA is still the most used AI algorithm, CNN has shown promising results, but due to their high technical implementation requirements, many researchers do not justify its implementation as worthwile. To achieve quick and accurate online BCIs for motor rehabilitation applications, future works on SSVEP-, P300-based and hybrid BCIs should focus on optimizing the visual stimulation module and the training stage of ML and DL algorithms.",

Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.",

    "abstract": "For many years people have speculated that electroencephalographic activity or other electrophysiological measures of brain function might provide a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world - a brain-computer interface (BCI). Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or 'locked in', with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10-25bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury can pose significant threats to human mortality, morbidity, and functional independence. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology, which facilitates direct communication between the brain and external devices, emerges as an innovative key to unlocking neurological conditions, demonstrating significant promise in this context. This comprehensive review uniquely synthesizes the latest advancements in BCI research across multiple neurological disorders, offering an interdisciplinary perspective on both clinical applications and emerging technologies. We explore the progress in BCI research and its applications in addressing various neurological conditions, with a particular focus on recent clinical studies and prospective developments. Initially, the review provides an up-to-date overview of BCI technology, encompassing its classification, operational principles, and prevalent paradigms. It then critically examines specific BCI applications in movement disorders, disorders of consciousness, cognitive and mental disorders, as well as sensory disorders, highlighting novel approaches and their potential impact on patient care. This review reveals emerging trends in BCI applications, such as the integration of artificial intelligence and the development of closed-loop systems, which represent significant advancements over previous technologies. The review concludes by discussing the prospects and directions of BCI technology, underscoring the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations. It emphasizes the importance of prioritizing bidirectional and high-performance BCIs, areas that have been underexplored in previous reviews. Additionally, we identify crucial gaps in current research, particularly in long-term clinical efficacy and the need for standardized protocols. The role of neurosurgery in spearheading the clinical translation of BCI research is highlighted. Our comprehensive analysis presents BCI technology as an innovative key to unlocking neurological disorders, offering a transformative approach to diagnosing, treating, and rehabilitating neurological conditions, with substantial potential to enhance patients' quality of life and advance the field of neurotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Advances in brain science and computer technology in the past decade have led to exciting developments in brain-computer interface (BCI), thereby making BCI a top research area in applied science. The renaissance of BCI opens new methods of neurorehabilitation for physically disabled people (e.g. paralyzed patients and amputees) and patients with brain injuries (e.g. stroke patients). Recent technological advances such as wireless recording, machine learning analysis, and real-time temporal resolution have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI approaches. Many BCI studies have focused on decoding EEG signals associated with whole-body kinematics/kinetics, motor imagery, and various senses. Thus, there is a need to understand the various experimental paradigms used in EEG-based BCI systems. Moreover, given that there are many available options, it is essential to choose the most appropriate BCI application to properly manipulate a neuroprosthetic or neurorehabilitation device. The current review evaluates EEG-based BCI paradigms regarding their advantages and disadvantages from a variety of perspectives. For each paradigm, various EEG decoding algorithms and classification methods are evaluated. The applications of these paradigms with targeted patients are summarized. Finally, potential problems with EEG-based BCI systems are discussed, and possible solutions are proposed.",

    "abstract": "This study explores neuroplasticity through the use of virtual reality (VR) and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections in response to learning, experience, and injury. VR offers a controlled environment to manipulate sensory inputs, while BCIs facilitate real-time monitoring and modulation of neural activity. By combining VR and BCI, researchers can stimulate specific brain regions, trigger neurochemical changes, and influence cognitive functions such as memory, perception, and motor skills. Key findings indicate that VR and BCI interventions are promising for rehabilitation therapies, treatment of phobias and anxiety disorders, and cognitive enhancement. Personalized VR experiences, adapted based on BCI feedback, enhance the efficacy of these interventions. This study underscores the potential for integrating VR and BCI technologies to understand and harness neuroplasticity for cognitive and therapeutic applications. The researchers utilized the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) method to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of the existing literature on neuroplasticity, VR, and BCI. This involved identifying relevant studies through database searches, screening for eligibility, and assessing the quality of the included studies. Data extraction focused on the effects of VR and BCI on neuroplasticity and cognitive functions. The PRISMA method ensured a rigorous and transparent approach to synthesizing evidence, allowing the researchers to draw robust conclusions about the potential of VR and BCI technologies in promoting neuroplasticity and cognitive enhancement.",

BCIs have the potential to improve the quality of life for many individuals affected by debilitating disorders of the brain, spine, limbs, and sensory organs through direct interface with the nervous system. While much progress has been made in terms of BCI motor control, significantly less attention has been given to the restoration of tactile, or cutaneous sensations, which can be very important during grasping or manipulation of objects. BCIs will need to integrate both the motor and sensory modalities to truly restore arm and hand function. Here we describe a bidirectional BCI, a system which translates neural signals recorded from the motor cortex into signals to control a device and provides somatosensory feedback by translating external sensor information to electric stimulation patterns delivered to the cortex. In this chapter, we review the neuroscience of somatosensation, the history of sensory feedback in BCI applications, specifically for restoration of hand function and cutaneous sensations, and describe additional work that needs to be completed to make bidirectional BCI a clinical reality.",

Although considerable effort has been devoted to evaluating classifiers using public datasets, more attention to real-time signal processing issues and to optimizing the mutually adaptive interaction between the brain and the BCI are essential for improving BCI performance.

Noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are popular due to considerable advantages including simplicity, safety, and low cost, while recent advances aim at improving past technological and neurophysiological limitations. Taking into account the neurophysiological alterations of disabled individuals, investigating brain connectivity features for implementation of BCI control holds special importance. Off-the-shelf BCI systems are based on fast, reproducible detection of mental activity and can be implemented in neurorobotic applications. Moreover, social Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is increasingly important in rehabilitation robotics development.

We account for robotics development, BCI implementation, and qualitative assessment of HRI characteristics of the system. Furthermore, we present two illustrative experimental applications of the BCI-controlled arms, a study of motor imagery modalities on healthy individuals' BCI performance, and a pilot investigation on spinal cord injured patients' BCI control and brain connectivity. We discuss strengths and limitations of our design and propose further steps on development and neurophysiological study, including implementation of connectivity features as BCI modality.",

    "abstract": "Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that uses electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to control external devices, such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). Visual BCI paradigms based on P300 and Steady State Visually Evoked potentials (SSVEP) have shown high potential for clinical purposes. Numerous studies have been published on P300- and SSVEP-based non-invasive BCIs, but many of them present two shortcomings: (1) they are not aimed for motor rehabilitation applications, and (2) they do not report in detail the artificial intelligence (AI) methods used for classification, or their performance metrics. To address this gap, in this paper the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology was applied to prepare a systematic literature review (SLR). Papers older than 10 years, repeated or not related to a motor rehabilitation application, were excluded. Of all the studies, 51.02% referred to theoretical analysis of classification algorithms. Of the remaining, 28.48% were for spelling, 12.73% for diverse applications (control of wheelchair or home appliances), and only 7.77% were focused on motor rehabilitation. After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and quality screening was performed, 34 articles were selected. Of them, 26.47% used the P300 and 55.8% the SSVEP signal. Five applications categories were established: Rehabilitation Systems (17.64%), Virtual Reality environments (23.52%), FES (17.64%), Orthosis (29.41%), and Prosthesis (11.76%). Of all the works, only four performed tests with patients. The most reported machine learning (ML) algorithms used for classification were linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (48.64%) and support vector machine (16.21%), while only one study used a deep learning algorithm: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The reported accuracy ranged from 38.02 to 100%, and the Information Transfer Rate from 1.55 to 49.25 bits per minute. While LDA is still the most used AI algorithm, CNN has shown promising results, but due to their high technical implementation requirements, many researchers do not justify its implementation as worthwile. To achieve quick and accurate online BCIs for motor rehabilitation applications, future works on SSVEP-, P300-based and hybrid BCIs should focus on optimizing the visual stimulation module and the training stage of ML and DL algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.",

    "abstract": "Performance estimation is a necessary step in the development and validation of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. Unfortunately, even modern BCI systems are slow, making collecting sufficient data for validation a time-consuming task for end users and experimenters alike. Yet without sufficient data, the random variation in performance can lead to false inferences about how well a BCI is working for a particular user. For example, P300 spellers commonly operate around 1-5 characters per minute. To estimate accuracy with a 5% resolution requires 20 characters (4-20 min). Despite this time investment, the confidence bounds for accuracy from 20 characters can be as much as ±23% depending on observed accuracy. A previously published method, Classifier-Based Latency Estimation (CBLE), was shown to be highly correlated with BCI accuracy. This work presents a protocol for using CBLE to predict a user's P300 speller accuracy from relatively few characters (~3-8) of typing data. The resulting confidence bounds are tighter than those produced by traditional methods. The method can thus be used to estimate BCI performance more quickly and/or more accurately.",

Training data is needed to learn the identification of brain activity. The more training data are available, the better the algorithms will perform. The availability of larger datasets is highly desirable, eventually obtained by merging datasets from different repositories. The main obstacle to such merging is that all public datasets are released in various file formats because no standard way is established to share these data. Additionally, all datasets necessitate reading documents or scientific papers to retrieve relevant information, which prevents automating the processing. In this study, we thus adopted a unique file format to demonstrate the importance of having a standard and to propose which information should be stored and why.",

Different visual configurations of the widely studied P300-based BCI speller had been assessed with healthy and motor-disabled users. However, the speller size (in terms of cm) had only been assessed for healthy subjects. We think that the speller size might be limiting for some severely motor-disabled patients with restricted head and eye movements. The usability of three speller sizes was assessed for seven patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a participant diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This is the first usability evaluation of speller size with severely motor-disabled participants. Effectiveness (in the online results) and efficiency (in the workload test) of the medium speller was remarkably better. Satisfaction was significantly the highest with the medium size speller and the lowest with the small size. These results correlate with previously described findings in healthy subjects. In conclusion, the speller size should be considered when designing a speller paradigm, especially for motor-disabled individuals, since it might affect their performance and user experience while controlling a BCI speller.",

Research has improved typing speed and accuracy through innovations including the use of language models. While significant advances have been made, implementations have largely been restricted to a single language, primarily English. It is unclear whether these improvements would extend to other languages that present potential technical hurdles due to different alphabets and grammatical structures. Here, we adapt a language model-based classifier designed for English to two other languages, Spanish and Greek, to demonstrate the generalizability of these methods. Online experimental trials with 30 healthy native English, Spanish, and Greek speakers showed no significant difference between performances using the different versions of the system (66.20 vs. 61.97 vs. 60.89 bits/minute). Extending these methods across languages allows for expanding access to BCI systems to other populations, particularly in the developing world.",

During the decades, BCI has made noticeable progress and has been applied in many fields. One of the most traditional BCI applications is the BCI speller. This article primarily discusses the progress of research into P300 BCI spellers and reviews four types of P300 spellers: single-modal P300 spellers, P300 spellers based on multiple brain patterns, P300 spellers with multisensory stimuli, and P300 spellers with multiple intelligent techniques. For each type of P300 speller, we further review several representative P300 spellers, including their design principles, paradigms, algorithms, experimental performance, and corresponding advantages. We particularly emphasized the paradigm design ideas, including the overall layout, individual symbol shapes and stimulus forms. Furthermore, several important issues and research guidance for the P300 speller were identified. We hope that this review can assist researchers in learning the new ideas of these novel P300 spellers and enhance their practical application capability.",

    "abstract": "For each brain-computer interface system, efficiency is a key issue that considers both accuracy and speed. The P300 spellers built upon oddball paradigm are usually less efficient due to the repetitive stimulation of multiple characters for reliable detection. In this paper, based on the online EEG signal, we propose an interactive paradigm for P300 speller to improve its efficiency, primarily focusing within the single characterP300 paradigm. Specifically, after each stimulation, we first evaluate the posterior probability of each character in the stimuli set to be the target. The lowprobability characters are then removed fromthe stimuli set in the subsequent round(s), as character flash continues until the probability of any character surpasses a predefined threshold. Then, the character is selected as the target and data collection for the trial terminates. By reducing stimulus sequence characters, the system efficiency can be substantially improved. The spelling accuracy is insignificantly affected as the characters being removed have low probability to be the target. The online experimental results from a total of eight subjects show that an average practical information transfer rate of 50.26 bits/min (i.e. 9.07 characters/min) has been achieved, with 91% average spelling accuracy rate.",

Once a group is selected, the characters in it will appear on the flashing buttons of the second level for the selection of desired character. In a spelling experiment involving 12 subjects, higher online accuracy was obtained on the RB paradigm-based P300 speller than the SC paradigm-based P300 speller.

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces are sophisticated signal processing systems, which directly operate on neuronal signals to identify specific human intents. These systems can be applied to overcome certain disabilities or to enhance the natural capabilities of human beings. The visual P300 mind-speller is a prominent one among them, which has opened up tremendous possibilities in movement and communication applications. Today, there exist many state-of-the-art visual P300 mind-speller implementations in the literature as a result of numerous researches in this domain over the past 2 decades. Each of these systems can be evaluated in terms of performance metrics like classification accuracy, information transfer rate, and processing time. Various classification techniques associated with these systems, which include but are not limited to discriminant analysis, support vector machine, neural network, distance-based and ensemble of classifiers, have major roles in determining the overall system performances. The significance of a proper review on the recent developments in visual P300 mind-spellers with proper emphasis on their classification algorithms is the key insight for this work. This article is organized with a brief introduction to P300, concepts of visual P300 mind-spellers, the survey of literature with special focus on classification algorithms, followed by the discussion of various challenges and future directions.",

    "abstract": "P300 spellers are mainly composed of an interface, by which alphanumerical characters are presented to users, and a classification system, which identifies the target character by using acquired EEG data. In this study, we proposed modifications both to the interface and to the classification system, in order to reduce the number of required stimulus repetitions and consequently boost the information transfer rate. We initially incorporated a custom-built dictionary into the classification system, and conducted a study on 14 healthy subjects who copy-spelled 15 four letter words. Incorporating the dictionary, the mean accuracy at five trials increased from 72.86% to 95.71%. To further increase the system performance, we first validated the hypothesis that for a conventional P300 system, most target-error pairs lie on the same row or column. Then based on the validated hypothesis, we adjusted letter positions on the well-known from A to Z interface. The same subjects spelled the same 15 words using the modified interface as well, and the mean information transfer rate at two trials reached 55.32 bits/min.",

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems were developed so that people can control computers or machines through their brain activity without moving their limbs. The P300 speller is one of the BCI applications used most commonly, as is very simple and reliable and can achieve satisfactory performance. However, like other BCIs, the P300 speller still has room for improvements in terms of its practical use, for example, selecting the best compromise between spelling accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR; speed) so that the P300 speller can maintain high accuracy while increasing spelling speed. Therefore, seeking correlates of, and predicting, the P300 speller's performance is necessary to understand and improve the technique. In this work, we investigated the correlations between rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task features and the P300 speller's performance. Fifty-five subjects participated in the RSVP and conventional matrix P300 speller tasks and RSVP behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) features were compared in the P300's speller performance. We found that several of the RSVP's event-related potential (ERP) and behavioral features were correlated with the P300 speller's offline binary classification accuracy. Using these features, we propose a simple multi-feature performance predictor (",

However, its use of visual stimulation limits its applicability to users with normal eyesight. Alternative BCI spelling systems which rely on non-visual stimulation, e.g. auditory or tactile, tend to perform much more poorly and/or can be very difficult to use. In this paper we present a novel extension of the matrix speller, based on flipping the letter matrix, which allows us to use the same interface for visual, auditory or simultaneous visual and auditory stimuli. In this way we aim to allow users to utilize the best available input modality for their situation, that is use visual + auditory for best performance and move smoothly to purely auditory when necessary, e.g. when disease causes the user's eyesight to deteriorate. Our results on seven healthy subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with our modified visual + auditory stimulation slightly out-performing the classic matrix speller. The purely auditory system performance was lower than for visual stimulation, but comparable to other auditory BCI systems.",

    "abstract": "A P300 brain-computer interface (BCI) is a paradigm, where text characters are decoded from event-related potentials (ERPs). In a popular implementation, called P300 speller, a subject looks at a display where characters are flashing and selects one character by attending to it. The selection is recognized as the item with the strongest ERP. The speller performs well when cortical responses to target and non-target stimuli are sufficiently different. Although many strategies have been proposed for improving the BCI spelling, a relatively simple one received insufficient attention in the literature: reduction of the visual field to diminish the contribution from non-target stimuli. Previously, this idea was implemented in a single-stimulus switch that issued an urgent command like stopping a robot. To tackle this approach further, we ran a pilot experiment where ten subjects operated a traditional P300 speller or wore a binocular aperture that confined their sight to the central visual field. As intended, visual field restriction resulted in a replacement of non-target ERPs with EEG rhythms asynchronous to stimulus periodicity. Changes in target ERPs were found in half of the subjects and were individually variable. While classification accuracy was slightly better for the aperture condition (84.3 ± 2.9%, mean ± standard error) than the no-aperture condition (81.0 ± 2.6%), this difference was not statistically significant for the entire sample of subjects (",

We first address the advantages of such a modular approach, and we explain how distributed signal processing algorithms make WESNs more power-efficient, in particular by avoiding data centralization. We provide an overview of distributed signal processing algorithms that are potentially applicable in WESNs, and for illustration purposes, we also provide a more detailed case study of a distributed eye blink artifact removal algorithm. Finally, we study the power efficiency of these distributed algorithms in comparison to their centralized counterparts in which all the raw sensor signals are centralized in a near-end or far-end fusion center.",

    "abstract": "With great advances in computer technology, the digital EEG machine was developed and has become widely used. In this paper, signal processing and quality of display of waveform at digital EEG machine were discussed to confirm its advantages and drawbacks. Signal processing on a digital EEG machine is summarized in 3 parts as follows: i) A/D conversion(sampling) of EEG signals in the head box, ii) Digital signal processing to obtain mathematically reconstructed EEG on the computer, iii) Displaying EEG on a monitor. For sampling, it was recommended that sampling rate was 200 or 256 Hz, and resolution in 12 bits or preferably 16 bits per sample. A high amplitude artifact caused EEG flattening called DC build up saturation. Montage reformatting had a clinical advantage. However, re-filtering using 15 Hz high cut filter influenced the EEG interpretation. The maximal resolution of digital EEG machine with a 17-inch CRT display using 1600 x 1200 dots was about 22 Hz. The performance of paper used for conventional EEG surpassed the performance of CRT display using digital EEG machine. It seemed that understanding the characteristics of digital EEG machine and realization of data processing were important for utilizing its functions effectively.",

Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.",

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been used as a way of facilitating communication between the brain and peripheral devices. The BCI provides an option to improve the walking pattern of people with poor walking dysfunction, by applying a rehabilitation process. A state-of-the-art step-wise BCI system includes data acquisition, pre-processing, channel selection, feature extraction, and classification. In fNIRS-based BCI (fNIRS-BCI), channel selection plays a vital role in enhancing the classification accuracy of the BCI problem. In this study, the concentration of blood oxygenation (HbO) in a resting state and in a walking state was used to decode the walking activity and the resting state of the subject, using channel selection by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) homotopy-based sparse representation classification. The fNIRS signals of nine subjects were collected from the left hemisphere of the primary motor cortex. The subjects performed the task of walking on a treadmill for 10 s, followed by a 20 s rest. Appropriate filters were applied to the collected signals to remove motion artifacts and physiological noises. LASSO homotopy-based sparse representation was used to select the most significant channels, and then classification was performed to identify walking and resting states. For comparison, the statistical spatial features of mean, peak, variance, and skewness, and their combination, were used for classification. The classification results after channel selection were then compared with the classification based on the extracted features. The classifiers used for both methods were linear discrimination analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The study found that LASSO homotopy-based sparse representation classification successfully discriminated between the walking and resting states, with a better average classification accuracy (p < 0.016) of 91.32%. This research provides a step forward in improving the classification accuracy of fNIRS-BCI systems. The proposed methodology may also be used for rehabilitation purposes, such as controlling wheelchairs and prostheses, as well as an active rehabilitation training technique for patients with motor dysfunction.",

Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks?",

    "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI) signals recorded by electroencephalography provide the most practical basis for conceiving brain-computer interfaces (BCI). These interfaces offer a high degree of freedom. This helps people with motor disabilities communicate with the device by tackling a sequence of motor imagery tasks. However, the extracting user-specific features and increasing the accuracy of the classifier remain as difficult tasks in MI-based BCI. In this work, we propose a new method using artificial neural network (ANN) enhancing the performance of the motor imagery classification. Feature extraction techniques, like time domain parameters, band power features, signal power features, and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), are studied and compared. Four classification algorithms are implemented which are Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and proposed ANN architecture. We added Batch Normalization layers to the proposed ANN architecture to improve the learning time and accuracy of the neural network. These layers also alleviate the effect of weight initialization and the addition of a regularization effect on the network. Our proposed method using ANN architecture achieves 0.5545 of kappa and 58.42% of accuracy on the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset. Our results show that the modified ANN method, with frequency and spatial features extracted by WPD and Common Spatial Pattern, respectively, offers a better classification compared to other current methods.",

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) based rehabilitation has been proven a promising method facilitating motor recovery. Recognizing motor intention is crucial for realizing BCI rehabilitation training. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) is a kind of electroencephalogram (EEG) inherent characteristics associated with motor intention. However, due to brain deficits poststroke, some patients are not able to generate ERD, which discourages them to be involved in BCI rehabilitation training. To boost ERD during motor imagery (MI), this paper investigates the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on BCI classification performance. Eleven subjects participated in this study. The experiment consisted of two conditions: rTMS + MI versus sham rTMS + MI, which were arranged on different days. MI tests with 64-channel EEG recording were arranged immediately before and after rTMS and sham rTMS. Time-frequency analysis were utilized to measure ERD changes. Common spatial pattern was used to extract features and linear discriminant analysis was used to calculate offline classification accuracies. Paired-sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank tests with post-hoc analysis were used to compare performance before and after stimulation. Statistically stronger ERD (-13.93±12.99%) was found after real rTMS compared with ERD (-5.71±21.25%) before real rTMS (p<0.05). Classification accuracy after real rTMS (70.71±10.32%) tended to be higher than that before real rTMS (66.50±8.48%) (p<0.1). However, no statistical differences were found after sham stimulation. This research provides an effective method in improving BCI performance by utilizing neural modulation.Clinical Relevance- This study offers a promising treatment for patients who cannot be recruited in BCI rehabilitation training due to poor BCI classification performance.",

The performance of cross-subject SSVEP classification has a strong impact on SSVEP-BCI. This study designed a cross subject generalization SSVEP classification model based on an improved transformer structure that uses domain generalization (DG). The global receptive field of multi-head self-attention is used to learn the global generalized SSVEP temporal information across subjects. This is combined with a parallel local convolution module, designed to avoid oversmoothing the oscillation characteristics of temporal SSVEP data and better fit the feature. Moreover, to improve the cross-subject calibration-free SSVEP classification performance, an DG method named StableNet is combined with the proposed convolutional transformer structure to form the DG-Conformer method, which can eliminate spurious correlations between SSVEP discriminative information and background noise to improve cross-subject generalization. Experiments on two public datasets, Benchmark and BETA, demonstrated the outstanding performance of the proposed DG-Conformer compared with other calibration-free methods, FBCCA, tt-CCA, Compact-CNN, FB-tCNN, and SSVEPNet. Additionally, DG-Conformer outperforms the classic calibration-required algorithms eCCA, eTRCA and eSSCOR when calibration is used. An incomplete partial stimulus calibration scheme was also explored on the Benchmark dataset, and it was demonstrated to be a potential solution for further high-performance personalized SSVEP-BCI with quick calibration.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the processing of motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) signals has been attracted for developing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, since feature extraction and classification of these signals are extremely difficult due to the inherent complexity and tendency to artifact properties of them. The BCI systems can provide a direct interaction pathway/channel between the brain and a peripheral device, hence the MI EEG-based BCI systems seem crucial to control external devices for patients suffering from motor disabilities. The current study presents a semi-supervised model based on three-stage feature extraction and machine learning algorithms for MI EEG signal classification in order to improve the classification accuracy with smaller number of deep features for distinguishing right- and left-hand MI tasks. Stockwell transform is employed at the first phase of the proposed feature extraction method to generate two-dimensional time-frequency maps (TFMs) from one-dimensional EEG signals. Next, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to find deep feature sets from TFMs. Then, the semi-supervised discriminant analysis (SDA) is utilized to minimize the number of descriptors. Finally, the performance of five classifiers, including support vector machine, discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, random forest, and the fusion of them are compared. The hyperparameters of SDA and mentioned classifiers are optimized by Bayesian optimization to maximize the accuracy. The presented model is validated using BCI competition II dataset III and BCI competition IV dataset 2b. The performance metrics of the proposed method indicate its efficiency for classifying MI EEG signals.",

    "abstract": "Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are AI-driven systems that capture brain activity patterns associated with mental imagination of movement and convert them into commands for external devices. Traditionally, MI-BCIs operate on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which require extensive signal processing and feature engineering to extract changes in sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) models have gained popularity for EEG classification as they provide a solution for automatic extraction of spatio-temporal features in the signals. However, past BCI studies that employed DL models, only attempted them with a small group of participants, without investigating the effectiveness of this approach for different user groups such as inefficient users. BCI inefficiency is a known and unsolved problem within BCI literature, generally defined as the inability of the user to produce the desired SMR patterns for the BCI classifier. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of DL models in capturing MI features particularly in the inefficient users. EEG signals from 54 subjects who performed a MI task of left- or right-hand grasp were recorded to compare the performance of two classification approaches; a ML approach vs. a DL approach. In the ML approach, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) was used for feature extraction and then Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model was employed for binary classification of the MI task. In the DL approach, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was constructed on the raw EEG signals. Additionally, subjects were divided into high vs. low performers based on their online BCI accuracy and the difference between the two classifiers' performance was compared between groups. Our results showed that the CNN model improved the classification accuracy for all subjects within the range of 2.37 to 28.28%, but more importantly, this improvement was significantly larger for low performers. Our findings show promise for employment of DL models on raw EEG signals in future MI-BCI systems, particularly for BCI inefficient users who are unable to produce desired sensorimotor patterns for conventional ML approaches.",

This study address to the binary classification problem of the motor imagery EEG data by using a sigmoid activation function-based extreme learning machines (ELM). We proposed a novel method of extracting the features from the EEG signals by first applying the independent component analysis (ICA) on the time series data and transforming the ICA time series data into Fourier domain and then extract the phase information from the Fourier spectrum. This phase information was further used to calculate the maximized cross-correlation connectivity matrix. The upper diagonal of this matrix was then vectorized and it serves as the basic feature for the ELM classification framework. By using the phase-only features we achieved 97.80% (p <; 0.0022) nested cross-validated classification accuracy. In addition, this process is relatively computationally inexpensive. Thus, it can be an excellent candidate for the motor imagery BCI applications.",

    "abstract": "Performance estimation is a necessary step in the development and validation of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. Unfortunately, even modern BCI systems are slow, making collecting sufficient data for validation a time-consuming task for end users and experimenters alike. Yet without sufficient data, the random variation in performance can lead to false inferences about how well a BCI is working for a particular user. For example, P300 spellers commonly operate around 1-5 characters per minute. To estimate accuracy with a 5% resolution requires 20 characters (4-20 min). Despite this time investment, the confidence bounds for accuracy from 20 characters can be as much as ±23% depending on observed accuracy. A previously published method, Classifier-Based Latency Estimation (CBLE), was shown to be highly correlated with BCI accuracy. This work presents a protocol for using CBLE to predict a user's P300 speller accuracy from relatively few characters (~3-8) of typing data. The resulting confidence bounds are tighter than those produced by traditional methods. The method can thus be used to estimate BCI performance more quickly and/or more accurately.",

Training data is needed to learn the identification of brain activity. The more training data are available, the better the algorithms will perform. The availability of larger datasets is highly desirable, eventually obtained by merging datasets from different repositories. The main obstacle to such merging is that all public datasets are released in various file formats because no standard way is established to share these data. Additionally, all datasets necessitate reading documents or scientific papers to retrieve relevant information, which prevents automating the processing. In this study, we thus adopted a unique file format to demonstrate the importance of having a standard and to propose which information should be stored and why.",

Different visual configurations of the widely studied P300-based BCI speller had been assessed with healthy and motor-disabled users. However, the speller size (in terms of cm) had only been assessed for healthy subjects. We think that the speller size might be limiting for some severely motor-disabled patients with restricted head and eye movements. The usability of three speller sizes was assessed for seven patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a participant diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This is the first usability evaluation of speller size with severely motor-disabled participants. Effectiveness (in the online results) and efficiency (in the workload test) of the medium speller was remarkably better. Satisfaction was significantly the highest with the medium size speller and the lowest with the small size. These results correlate with previously described findings in healthy subjects. In conclusion, the speller size should be considered when designing a speller paradigm, especially for motor-disabled individuals, since it might affect their performance and user experience while controlling a BCI speller.",

Research has improved typing speed and accuracy through innovations including the use of language models. While significant advances have been made, implementations have largely been restricted to a single language, primarily English. It is unclear whether these improvements would extend to other languages that present potential technical hurdles due to different alphabets and grammatical structures. Here, we adapt a language model-based classifier designed for English to two other languages, Spanish and Greek, to demonstrate the generalizability of these methods. Online experimental trials with 30 healthy native English, Spanish, and Greek speakers showed no significant difference between performances using the different versions of the system (66.20 vs. 61.97 vs. 60.89 bits/minute).

During the decades, BCI has made noticeable progress and has been applied in many fields. One of the most traditional BCI applications is the BCI speller. This article primarily discusses the progress of research into P300 BCI spellers and reviews four types of P300 spellers: single-modal P300 spellers, P300 spellers based on multiple brain patterns, P300 spellers with multisensory stimuli, and P300 spellers with multiple intelligent techniques. For each type of P300 speller, we further review several representative P300 spellers, including their design principles, paradigms, algorithms, experimental performance, and corresponding advantages. We particularly emphasized the paradigm design ideas, including the overall layout, individual symbol shapes and stimulus forms. Furthermore, several important issues and research guidance for the P300 speller were identified. We hope that this review can assist researchers in learning the new ideas of these novel P300 spellers and enhance their practical application capability.",

    "abstract": "For each brain-computer interface system, efficiency is a key issue that considers both accuracy and speed. The P300 spellers built upon oddball paradigm are usually less efficient due to the repetitive stimulation of multiple characters for reliable detection. In this paper, based on the online EEG signal, we propose an interactive paradigm for P300 speller to improve its efficiency, primarily focusing within the single characterP300 paradigm. Specifically, after each stimulation, we first evaluate the posterior probability of each character in the stimuli set to be the target. The lowprobability characters are then removed fromthe stimuli set in the subsequent round(s), as character flash continues until the probability of any character surpasses a predefined threshold. Then, the character is selected as the target and data collection for the trial terminates. By reducing stimulus sequence characters, the system efficiency can be substantially improved. The spelling accuracy is insignificantly affected as the characters being removed have low probability to be the target. The online experimental results from a total of eight subjects show that an average practical information transfer rate of 50.26 bits/min (i.e. 9.07 characters/min) has been achieved, with 91% average spelling accuracy rate.",

Once a group is selected, the characters in it will appear on the flashing buttons of the second level for the selection of desired character. In a spelling experiment involving 12 subjects, higher online accuracy was obtained on the RB paradigm-based P300 speller than the SC paradigm-based P300 speller. Furthermore, we analyzed P300 detection performance, the P300 waveforms and Fisher ratios using the data collected by the two spellers.

Today, there exist many state-of-the-art visual P300 mind-speller implementations in the literature as a result of numerous researches in this domain over the past 2 decades. Each of these systems can be evaluated in terms of performance metrics like classification accuracy, information transfer rate, and processing time. Various classification techniques associated with these systems, which include but are not limited to discriminant analysis, support vector machine, neural network, distance-based and ensemble of classifiers, have major roles in determining the overall system performances. The significance of a proper review on the recent developments in visual P300 mind-spellers with proper emphasis on their classification algorithms is the key insight for this work.

We initially incorporated a custom-built dictionary into the classification system, and conducted a study on 14 healthy subjects who copy-spelled 15 four letter words. Incorporating the dictionary, the mean accuracy at five trials increased from 72.86% to 95.71%. To further increase the system performance, we first validated the hypothesis that for a conventional P300 system, most target-error pairs lie on the same row or column. Then based on the validated hypothesis, we adjusted letter positions on the well-known from A to Z interface. The same subjects spelled the same 15 words using the modified interface as well, and the mean information transfer rate at two trials reached 55.32 bits/min.",

The P300 speller is one of the BCI applications used most commonly, as is very simple and reliable and can achieve satisfactory performance. However, like other BCIs, the P300 speller still has room for improvements in terms of its practical use, for example, selecting the best compromise between spelling accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR; speed) so that the P300 speller can maintain high accuracy while increasing spelling speed. Therefore, seeking correlates of, and predicting, the P300 speller's performance is necessary to understand and improve the technique. In this work, we investigated the correlations between rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task features and the P300 speller's performance. Fifty-five subjects participated in the RSVP and conventional matrix P300 speller tasks and RSVP behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) features were compared in the P300's speller performance. We found that several of the RSVP's event-related potential (ERP) and behavioral features were correlated with the P300 speller's offline binary classification accuracy. Using these features, we propose a simple multi-feature performance predictor (",

    "abstract": "The Farwell and Donchin matrix speller is well known as one of the highest performing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) currently available. However, its use of visual stimulation limits its applicability to users with normal eyesight. Alternative BCI spelling systems which rely on non-visual stimulation, e.g. auditory or tactile, tend to perform much more poorly and/or can be very difficult to use. In this paper we present a novel extension of the matrix speller, based on flipping the letter matrix, which allows us to use the same interface for visual, auditory or simultaneous visual and auditory stimuli. In this way we aim to allow users to utilize the best available input modality for their situation, that is use visual + auditory for best performance and move smoothly to purely auditory when necessary, e.g. when disease causes the user's eyesight to deteriorate. Our results on seven healthy subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with our modified visual + auditory stimulation slightly out-performing the classic matrix speller. The purely auditory system performance was lower than for visual stimulation, but comparable to other auditory BCI systems.",

    "abstract": "A P300 brain-computer interface (BCI) is a paradigm, where text characters are decoded from event-related potentials (ERPs). In a popular implementation, called P300 speller, a subject looks at a display where characters are flashing and selects one character by attending to it. The selection is recognized as the item with the strongest ERP. The speller performs well when cortical responses to target and non-target stimuli are sufficiently different. Although many strategies have been proposed for improving the BCI spelling, a relatively simple one received insufficient attention in the literature: reduction of the visual field to diminish the contribution from non-target stimuli. Previously, this idea was implemented in a single-stimulus switch that issued an urgent command like stopping a robot. To tackle this approach further, we ran a pilot experiment where ten subjects operated a traditional P300 speller or wore a binocular aperture that confined their sight to the central visual field. As intended, visual field restriction resulted in a replacement of non-target ERPs with EEG rhythms asynchronous to stimulus periodicity. Changes in target ERPs were found in half of the subjects and were individually variable. While classification accuracy was slightly better for the aperture condition (84.3 ± 2.9%, mean ± standard error) than the no-aperture condition (81.0 ± 2.6%), this difference was not statistically significant for the entire sample of subjects (",

    "abstract": "Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.",

We first address the advantages of such a modular approach, and we explain how distributed signal processing algorithms make WESNs more power-efficient, in particular by avoiding data centralization. We provide an overview of distributed signal processing algorithms that are potentially applicable in WESNs, and for illustration purposes, we also provide a more detailed case study of a distributed eye blink artifact removal algorithm. Finally, we study the power efficiency of these distributed algorithms in comparison to their centralized counterparts in which all the raw sensor signals are centralized in a near-end or far-end fusion center.",

    "abstract": "With great advances in computer technology, the digital EEG machine was developed and has become widely used. In this paper, signal processing and quality of display of waveform at digital EEG machine were discussed to confirm its advantages and drawbacks. Signal processing on a digital EEG machine is summarized in 3 parts as follows: i) A/D conversion(sampling) of EEG signals in the head box, ii) Digital signal processing to obtain mathematically reconstructed EEG on the computer, iii) Displaying EEG on a monitor. For sampling, it was recommended that sampling rate was 200 or 256 Hz, and resolution in 12 bits or preferably 16 bits per sample. A high amplitude artifact caused EEG flattening called DC build up saturation. Montage reformatting had a clinical advantage. However, re-filtering using 15 Hz high cut filter influenced the EEG interpretation. The maximal resolution of digital EEG machine with a 17-inch CRT display using 1600 x 1200 dots was about 22 Hz. The performance of paper used for conventional EEG surpassed the performance of CRT display using digital EEG machine. It seemed that understanding the characteristics of digital EEG machine and realization of data processing were important for utilizing its functions effectively.",

EEG is not only an essential tool for diagnosing diseases and disorders affecting the brain, but also helps us to achieve a better understanding of brain's activities and structures. EEG recordings are weak, nonlinear, and nonstationary signals that contain various noise and artifacts. Therefore, for analyzing them, advanced signal processing techniques are required. Second order statistical features are usually sufficient for analyzing most basic signals. However, higher order statistical features possess characteristics that are missing in the second order; characteristics that can be highly beneficial for analysis of more complex signals, such as EEG. The primary goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive survey of the applications of higher order statistics or spectra (HOS) in EEG signal processing. Therefore, we start the survey with a summary of previous studies in EEG analysis followed by a brief mathematical description of HOS. Then, HOS related features and their applications in EEG analysis are presented. These applications are then grouped into three categories, each of which are further explored thoroughly with examples of prior studies. Finally, we provide some specific recommendations based on the literature survey and discuss possible future directions of this field.",

    "abstract": "When traditional EEG signals are collected based on the Nyquist theorem, long-time recordings of EEG signals will produce a large amount of data. At the same time, limited bandwidth, end-to-end delay, and memory space will bring great pressure on the effective transmission of data. The birth of compressed sensing alleviates this transmission pressure. However, using an iterative compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm for EEG signal reconstruction faces complex calculation problems and slow data processing speed, limiting the application of compressed sensing in EEG signal rapid monitoring systems. As such, this paper presents a non-iterative and fast algorithm for reconstructing EEG signals using compressed sensing and deep learning techniques. This algorithm uses the improved residual network model, extracts the feature information of the EEG signal by one-dimensional dilated convolution, directly learns the nonlinear mapping relationship between the measured value and the original signal, and can quickly and accurately reconstruct the EEG signal. The method proposed in this paper has been verified by simulation on the open BCI contest dataset. Overall, it is proved that the proposed method has higher reconstruction accuracy and faster reconstruction speed than the traditional CS reconstruction algorithm and the existing deep learning reconstruction algorithm. In addition, it can realize the rapid reconstruction of EEG signals.",

One method that has been gaining popularity in recent years is Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), which is highly effective in eliminating large amplitude and transient artifacts in EEG data. However, traditional ASR is not possible to use with single-channel EEG data. In this study, we propose incorporating signal decomposition techniques such as ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), wavelet transform (WT), and singular spectrum analysis (SSA) into ASR, to decompose single-channel data into multiple components. This allows the ASR process to be applied effectively to the data. Our results show that the proposed single-channel version of ASR outperforms its counterpart Independent Component Analysis (ICA) methods when tested on two open datasets. Our findings indicate that ASR has significant potential as a powerful tool for removing artifacts from EEG data analysis.Clinical Relevance- This provided artifact removal technique for single-channel EEG.",

Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.",

We first address the advantages of such a modular approach, and we explain how distributed signal processing algorithms make WESNs more power-efficient, in particular by avoiding data centralization. We provide an overview of distributed signal processing algorithms that are potentially applicable in WESNs, and for illustration purposes, we also provide a more detailed case study of a distributed eye blink artifact removal algorithm. Finally, we study the power efficiency of these distributed algorithms in comparison to their centralized counterparts in which all the raw sensor signals are centralized in a near-end or far-end fusion center.",

    "abstract": "With great advances in computer technology, the digital EEG machine was developed and has become widely used. In this paper, signal processing and quality of display of waveform at digital EEG machine were discussed to confirm its advantages and drawbacks. Signal processing on a digital EEG machine is summarized in 3 parts as follows: i) A/D conversion(sampling) of EEG signals in the head box, ii) Digital signal processing to obtain mathematically reconstructed EEG on the computer, iii) Displaying EEG on a monitor. For sampling, it was recommended that sampling rate was 200 or 256 Hz, and resolution in 12 bits or preferably 16 bits per sample. A high amplitude artifact caused EEG flattening called DC build up saturation. Montage reformatting had a clinical advantage. However, re-filtering using 15 Hz high cut filter influenced the EEG interpretation. The maximal resolution of digital EEG machine with a 17-inch CRT display using 1600 x 1200 dots was about 22 Hz. The performance of paper used for conventional EEG surpassed the performance of CRT display using digital EEG machine. It seemed that understanding the characteristics of digital EEG machine and realization of data processing were important for utilizing its functions effectively.",

We empirically show that our method gives similar results that the surface Laplacian in the noiseless case while being more robust to noise or defective electrodes.Clinical relevance- The proposed method is an alternative to the surface Laplacian filter that is commonly used for processing EEG signals. It could be used in cases where this standard approach does not provide satisfying results (low signal-to-noise ratios due to a low number of epochs, defective electrodes).

EEG is not only an essential tool for diagnosing diseases and disorders affecting the brain, but also helps us to achieve a better understanding of brain's activities and structures. EEG recordings are weak, nonlinear, and nonstationary signals that contain various noise and artifacts. Therefore, for analyzing them, advanced signal processing techniques are required. Second order statistical features are usually sufficient for analyzing most basic signals. However, higher order statistical features possess characteristics that are missing in the second order; characteristics that can be highly beneficial for analysis of more complex signals, such as EEG. The primary goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive survey of the applications of higher order statistics or spectra (HOS) in EEG signal processing. Therefore, we start the survey with a summary of previous studies in EEG analysis followed by a brief mathematical description of HOS. Then, HOS related features and their applications in EEG analysis are presented. These applications are then grouped into three categories, each of which are further explored thoroughly with examples of prior studies. Finally, we provide some specific recommendations based on the literature survey and discuss possible future directions of this field.",

    "abstract": "When traditional EEG signals are collected based on the Nyquist theorem, long-time recordings of EEG signals will produce a large amount of data. At the same time, limited bandwidth, end-to-end delay, and memory space will bring great pressure on the effective transmission of data. The birth of compressed sensing alleviates this transmission pressure. However, using an iterative compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm for EEG signal reconstruction faces complex calculation problems and slow data processing speed, limiting the application of compressed sensing in EEG signal rapid monitoring systems. As such, this paper presents a non-iterative and fast algorithm for reconstructing EEG signals using compressed sensing and deep learning techniques. This algorithm uses the improved residual network model, extracts the feature information of the EEG signal by one-dimensional dilated convolution, directly learns the nonlinear mapping relationship between the measured value and the original signal, and can quickly and accurately reconstruct the EEG signal. The method proposed in this paper has been verified by simulation on the open BCI contest dataset. Overall, it is proved that the proposed method has higher reconstruction accuracy and faster reconstruction speed than the traditional CS reconstruction algorithm and the existing deep learning reconstruction algorithm. In addition, it can realize the rapid reconstruction of EEG signals.",

One method that has been gaining popularity in recent years is Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), which is highly effective in eliminating large amplitude and transient artifacts in EEG data. However, traditional ASR is not possible to use with single-channel EEG data. In this study, we propose incorporating signal decomposition techniques such as ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), wavelet transform (WT), and singular spectrum analysis (SSA) into ASR, to decompose single-channel data into multiple components. This allows the ASR process to be applied effectively to the data. Our results show that the proposed single-channel version of ASR outperforms its counterpart Independent Component Analysis (ICA) methods when tested on two open datasets. Our findings indicate that ASR has significant potential as a powerful tool for removing artifacts from EEG data analysis.Clinical Relevance- This provided artifact removal technique for single-channel EEG.",

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space. Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9% on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery. These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based P300 speller brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face three main challenges: low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor generalization, and time-consuming calibration. We propose SpellerSSL, a framework that combines self-supervised learning (SSL) with P300 aggregation to address these issues. First, we introduce an aggregation strategy to enhance SNR. Second, to achieve generalization in training, we employ a customized 1D U-Net backbone and pretrain the model on both cross-domain and in-domain EEG data. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned with a lightweight ERP-Head classifier for P300 detection, which adapts the learned representations to subject-specific data. Our evaluations on calibration time demonstrate that combining the aggregation strategy with SSL significantly reduces the calibration burden per subject and improves robustness across subjects. Experimental results show that SSL learns effective EEG representations in both in-domain and cross-domain, with in-domain achieving a state-of-the-art character recognition rate of 94% with only 7 repetitions and the highest information transfer rate (ITR) of 21.86 bits/min on the public II-B dataset. Moreover, in-domain SSL with P300 aggregation reduces the required calibration size by 60% while maintaining a comparable character recognition rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply SSL to P300 spellers, highlighting its potential to improve both efficiency and generalization in speller BCIs and paving the way toward an EEG foundation model for P300 speller BCIs.",

Analysis of the publicly available Eye-BCI multimodal dataset demonstrates the method's ability to recover canonical P300 characteristics across frequency bands (delta: 0.5-4 Hz, theta: 4-7.5 Hz, broadband: 1-15 Hz), with precise spatiotemporal localization of both P3a (frontocentral) and P3b (parietal) subcomponents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess the impact of noise interval selection on EEG signal quality. Cross-session correlations for four different choices of noise intervals spanning from early to late pre-stimulus phases also indicate that alertness and task engagement states modulate noise interval sensitivity, suggesting broader applications for adaptive BCI systems.

These neurophysiological signals have exhibited robust efficacy and versatility in external device control, demonstrating enhanced precision and scalability. However, conventional implementations predominantly utilise liquid crystal display (LCD)-based visual stimulation paradigms, which present limitations in practical deployment scenarios. This investigation presents the development and evaluation of a novel light-emitting diode (LED)-based dual stimulation apparatus designed to enhance SSVEP classification accuracy through the integration of both SSVEP and P300 paradigms. The system employs four distinct frequencies, 7 Hz, 8 Hz, 9 Hz, and 10 Hz, corresponding to forward, backward, right, and left directional controls, respectively. Oscilloscopic verification confirmed the precision of these stimulation frequencies. Real-time feature extraction was accomplished through the concurrent analysis of maximum Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) amplitude and P300 peak detection to ascertain user intent. Directional control was determined by the frequency exhibiting maximal amplitude characteristics. The visual stimulation hardware demonstrated minimal frequency deviation, with error differentials ranging from 0.15%to 0.20%across all frequencies. The implemented signal processing algorithm successfully discriminated all four stimulus frequencies whilst correlating them with their respective P300 event markers. Classification accuracy was evaluated based on correct task intention recognition. The proposed hybrid system achieved a mean classification accuracy of 86.25%, coupled with an average ITR of 42.08 bits per minute (bpm).",

Virtual reality (VR) provides a particularly relevant domain, where existing input methods often force trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and physical effort. This study introduces NeuroGaze, a hybrid interface combining electroencephalography (EEG) with eye tracking to enable hands-free interaction in immersive VR. Twenty participants completed a 360{\\deg} cube-selection task using three different input methods: VR controllers, gaze combined with a pinch gesture, and NeuroGaze. Performance was measured by task completion time and error rate, while workload was evaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). NeuroGaze successfully supported target selection with off-the-shelf hardware, producing fewer errors than the alternative methods but requiring longer completion times, reflecting a classic speed-accuracy tradeoff. Workload analysis indicated reduced physical demand for NeuroGaze compared to controllers, though overall ratings and user preferences were mixed. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of hybrid EEG+gaze systems for everyday VR use, highlighting their ergonomic benefits and inclusivity potential. Although not yet competitive in speed, NeuroGaze points toward a practical role for consumer-grade BCIs in accessibility and long-duration applications, and underscores the need for improved EEG signal processing and adaptive multimodal integration to enhance future performance.",

Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample.

Compared with invasively recorded electroencephalography (EEG), non-invasive recording offers a more practical and feasible approach to capturing brain signals for BCI. This study explores the limit of decoding non-invasive EEG associated with handwriting imagery into English letters using deep neural networks. To this end, five participants were instructed to imagine writing the 26 English letters with their EEG being recorded from the scalp. A measurement of EEG similarity across letters was conducted to investigate letter-specific patterns in the dataset. Subsequently, four convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained for EEG classification. Descriptively, the EEG data clearly exhibited letter-specific patterns serving as a proof-of-concept for EEG-to-text translation. Under the chance level of accuracy at 3.85%, the CNN classifiers trained on each participant reached the highest limit of around 20%. This study marks the first attempt to decode non-invasive EEG associated with handwriting imagery. Although the achieved accuracy is not sufficient for a usable brain-to-text BCI, the model's performance is noteworthy in revealing the potential for translating non-invasively recorded brain signals into text outputs and establishing a baseline for future research.",

One of the major challenges hindering the real-world deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU recordings for training, just 0.2346\\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base model.

However, existing BCI frameworks face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software, and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding, ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI development and thus accelerate their research endeavors.

    "abstract": "We present a new large-scale electroencephalography (EEG) dataset as part of the THINGS initiative, comprising over 1.6 million visual stimulus trials collected from 20 participants, and totaling more than twice the size of the most popular current benchmark dataset, THINGS-EEG2. Crucially, our data was recorded using a 32-channel consumer-grade wet electrode system costing ~$2.2k, around 27x cheaper than research-grade EEG systems typically used in cognitive neuroscience labs. Our work is one of the first open-source, large-scale EEG resource designed to closely reflect the quality of hardware that is practical to deploy in real-world, downstream applications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We aim to explore the specific question of whether deep neural network-based BCI research and semantic decoding methods can be effectively conducted with such affordable systems, filling an important gap in current literature that is extremely relevant for future research. In our analysis, we not only demonstrate that decoding of high-level semantic information from EEG of visualized images is possible at consumer-grade hardware, but also that our data can facilitate effective EEG-to-Image reconstruction even despite significantly lower signal-to-noise ratios. In addition to traditional benchmarks, we also conduct analyses of EEG-to-Image models that demonstrate log-linear decoding performance with increasing data volume on our data, and discuss the trade-offs between hardware cost, signal fidelity, and the scale of data collection efforts in increasing the size and utility of currently available datasets. Our contributions aim to pave the way for large-scale, cost-effective EEG research with widely accessible equipment, and position our dataset as a unique resource for the democratization and development of effective deep neural models of visual cognition.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have been frequently used to decode a single brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm based on electroencephalography (EEG). It is challenging to decode multiple BCI paradigms using one model due to diverse barriers, such as different channel configurations and disparate task-related representations. In this study, we propose Dual Local-Global Encoder (DLGE), enabling the classification across different BCI paradigms. To address the heterogeneity in EEG channel configurations across paradigms, we employ an anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding strategy to standardize EEG channel configuration. In the proposed model, the local encoder is designed to learn shared features across BCI paradigms within each brain region based on time-frequency information, which integrates temporal attention on individual channels with spatial attention among channels for each brain region. These shared features are subsequently aggregated in the global encoder to form respective paradigm-specific feature representations. Three BCI paradigms (motor imagery, resting state, and driving fatigue) were used to evaluate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of processing diverse BCI paradigms without retraining and retuning, achieving average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 60.16\\%, 59.88\\%, and 59.56\\%, respectively. We made an initial attempt to develop a general model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification, avoiding retraining or redevelopment for each paradigm. This study paves the way for the development of an effective but simple model for cross-BCI-paradigm decoding, which might benefit the design of portable devices for universal BCI decoding.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the neural correlates of sensory imagery is crucial for advancing cognitive neuroscience and developing novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigms. This study investigated the influence of imagined temperature sensations (ITS) on neural activity within the sensorimotor cortex. The experimental study involved the evaluation of neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) during both real thermal stimulation (TS: 40{\\deg}C Hot, 20{\\deg}C Cold) applied to the participants' hand, and the mental temperature imagination (ITS) of the corresponding hot and cold sensations. The analysis focused on quantifying the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm (8-13 Hz). The experimental results revealed a characteristic mu-ERD localized over central scalp regions (e.g., C3) during both TS and ITS conditions. Although the magnitude of mu-ERD during ITS was slightly lower than during TS, this difference was not statistically significant (p>.05). However, ERD during both ITS and TS was statistically significantly different from the resting baseline (p<.001). These findings demonstrate that imagining temperature sensations engages sensorimotor cortical mechanisms in a manner comparable to actual thermal perception. This insight expands our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of sensory imagery and suggests the potential utility of ITS for non-motor BCI control and neurorehabilitation technologies.",

    "abstract": "The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that enables direct communication between the human body and an external device. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition. Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and classification of MI-EEG.",

Confusion naturally arises when new information conflicts with or exceeds a reader's comprehension or prior knowledge, posing a challenge for learning. In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential (ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG + eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time monitoring. These findings lay the foundation for developing adaptive systems that dynamically detect and respond to user confusion, with potential applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and accessibility.",

Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.",

However, most current methods do not consider EEG feature information in spatial, temporal and spectral domains, and the structure of these models cannot effectively extract discriminative features, resulting in limited classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel text motor-imagery EEG discrimination method, namely wavelet-based temporal-spectral-attention correlation coefficient (WTS-CC), to simultaneously consider the features and their weighting in spatial, EEG-channel, temporal and spectral domains in this study. The initial Temporal Feature Extraction (iTFE) module extracts the initial important temporal features of MI EEG signals. The Deep EEG-Channel-attention (DEC) module is then proposed to automatically adjust the weight of each EEG channel according to its importance, thereby effectively enhancing more important EEG channels and suppressing less important EEG channels. Next, the Wavelet-based Temporal-Spectral-attention (WTS) module is proposed to obtain more significant discriminative features between different MI tasks by weighting features on two-dimensional time-frequency maps. Finally, a simple discrimination module is used for MI EEG discrimination. The experimental results indicate that the proposed text WTS-CC method can achieve promising discrimination performance that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy, Kappa coefficient, F1 score, and AUC on three public datasets.",

When employed in a brain-computer interface (BCI) supported by electroencephalographic (EEG) sensors, it can be used as a successful method of human-computer interaction. In this paper, the performance of six different classifiers, namely linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and three classifiers from the family of convolutional neural networks (CNN), is evaluated using EEG MI datasets. The study investigates the effectiveness of these classifiers on MI, guided by a static visual cue, dynamic visual guidance, and a combination of dynamic visual and vibrotactile (somatosensory) guidance. The effect of filtering passband during data preprocessing was also investigated. The results show that the ResNet-based CNN significantly outperforms the competing classifiers on both vibrotactile and visually guided data when detecting different directions of MI. Preprocessing the data using low-frequency signal features proves to be a better solution to achieve higher classification accuracy. It has also been shown that vibrotactile guidance has a significant impact on classification accuracy, with the associated improvement particularly evident for architecturally simpler classifiers. These findings have important implications for the development of EEG-based BCIs, as they provide valuable insight into the suitability of different classifiers for different contexts of use.",

Since the mental task has similar behavior to that of the motor execution process, it can be used to create rehabilitation routines for patients with some motor skill impairment. However, due to the nature of this mental task, its execution is complicated. Hence, the classification of these signals in scenarios such as brain-computer interface systems tends to have a poor performance. In this work, we study in depth different forms of data representation of motor imagery EEG signals for distinct CNN-based models as well as novel EEG data representations including spectrograms and multidimensional raw data. With the aid of transfer learning, we achieve results up to 93% accuracy, exceeding the current state of the art. However, although these results are strong, they entail the use of high computational resources to generate the samples, since they are based on spectrograms. Thus, we searched further for alternative forms of EEG representations, based on 1D, 2D, and 3D variations of the raw data, leading to promising results for motor imagery classification that still exceed the state of the art. Hence, in this work, we focus on exploring alternative methods to process and improve the classification of motor imagery features with few preprocessing techniques.",

MI was performed in 20 s on and 20 s off intervals to mimic functional magnetic resonance imaging. Neurofeedback in the form of a cortical slice presenting the motor cortex was provided from a frequency band with the strongest activity during real movements. The sLORETA processing delay was 250 ms. Session 1 resulted in bilateral/contralateral activity in the 8-15 Hz band dominantly over the prefrontal cortex while session 2 resulted in ipsi/bilateral activity over the primary motor cortex, covering similar areas as during motor execution. Different frequency bands and spatial distributions in sessions with and without neurofeedback may reflect different motor strategies, most notably a larger proprioception in session 1 and operant conditioning in session 2. Single-leg MI might be used in the early phases of rehabilitation of stroke patients. Simpler visual feedback and motor cueing rather than sustained MI might further increase the intensity of cortical activation.",

The progress in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has emphasized the importance of accurately and efficiently detecting motor imagery intentions from electroencephalogram (EEG). Despite the recent breakthroughs made in developing EEG-based algorithms for decoding MI, the accuracy and efficiency of these models remain limited by technical challenges posed by cross-subject heterogeneity in EEG data processing and the scarcity of EEG data for training. Inspired by the optimal transport theory, this study aims to develop a novel three-stage transfer learning (TSTL) method, which uses the existing labeled data from a source domain to improve classification performance on an unlabeled target domain. Notably, the proposed method comprises three components, namely, the Riemannian tangent space mapping (RTSM), source domain transformer (SDT), and optimal subspace mapping (OSM). The RTSM maps a symmetric positive definite matrix from the Riemannian space to the tangent space to minimize the marginal probability distribution drift. The SDT transforms the source domain to a target domain by finding the optimal transport mapping matrix to reduce the joint probability distribution differences. The OSM finally maps the transformed source domain and original target domain to the same subspace to further mitigate the distribution discrepancy. The performance of the proposed method was validated on two public BCI datasets, and the average accuracy of the algorithm on two datasets was 72.24% and 69.29%. Our results demonstrated the improved performance of EEG-based MI detection in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.",

The signals have been acquired from a portable EEG device equipped with eight dry electrodes. We employed sliding window strategies to segment the data, along with feature extraction using the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) method. Classification modules were implemented based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models. The experimentation involved five participants, each with their own personalized model. While the accuracy of results in the four-class tasks is not notably high, the outcomes in binary classification tasks are promising, boasting an average accuracy of approximately 61%. Results suggest a promising potential for this approach in the realm of robot control, particularly when employing dry-electrode EEG devices.",

    "abstract": "The research on the electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is widely utilized for wheelchair control. The ability of the user is one factor of BCI efficiency. Therefore, we focused on BCI tasks and protocols to yield high efficiency from the robust EEG features of individual users. This study proposes a task-based brain activity to gain the power of the alpha band, which included eyes closed for alpha response at the occipital area, attention to an upward arrow for alpha response at the frontal area, and an imagined left/right motor for alpha event-related desynchronization at the left/right motor cortex. An EPOC X neuroheadset was used to acquire the EEG signals. We also proposed user proficiency in motor imagery sessions with limb movement paradigms by recommending motor imagination tasks. Using the proposed system, we verified the feature extraction algorithms and command translation. Twelve volunteers participated in the experiment, and the conventional paradigm of motor imagery was used to compare the efficiencies. With utilized user proficiency in motor imagery, an average accuracy of 83.7% across the left and right commands was achieved. The recommended MI paradigm via user proficiency achieved an approximately 4% higher accuracy than the conventional MI paradigm. Moreover, the real-time control results of a simulated wheelchair revealed a high efficiency based on the time condition. The time results for the same task as the joystick-based control were still approximately three times longer. We suggest that user proficiency be used to recommend an individual MI paradigm for beginners. Furthermore, the proposed BCI system can be used for electric wheelchair control by people with severe disabilities.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) is one of brain computer interface (BCI) paradigms, which aims to build a direct communication pathway between human brain and external devices by decoding the brain activities. In a traditional way, MI BCI replies on a single brain, which suffers from the limitations, such as low accuracy and weak stability. To alleviate these limitations, multi-brain BCI has emerged based on the integration of multiple individuals' intelligence. Nevertheless, the existing decoding methods mainly use linear averaging or feature integration learning from multi-brain EEG data, and do not effectively utilize coupling relationship features, resulting in undesired decoding accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we proposed an EEG-based multi-brain MI decoding method, which utilizes coupling feature extraction and few-shot learning to capture coupling relationship features among multi-brains with only limited EEG data. We performed an experiment to collect EEG data from multiple persons who engaged in the same task simultaneously and compared the methods on the collected data. The comparison results showed that our proposed method improved the performance by 14.23% compared to the single-brain mode in the 10-shot three-class decoding task. It demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and usability of the method in the context of only small amount of EEG data available.",

Hybrid motor imagery (MI) decoding methods that based on multi-modal fusion of Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), especially deep learning-based methods, become popular in recent MI-BCI studies. However, the fusion strategy and network design in deep learning-based methods are complex. To solve this problem, we proposed the multi-channel fusion method (MCF) to simplify current fusion methods, and we designed a multi-channel fusion hybrid network (MCFHNet) based on MCF. MCFHNet combines depthwise convolutional layers, channel attention mechanism, and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) layers, which enables strong capability of feature extraction in spatial and temporal domain. The comparison between MCFHNet and representative deep learning-based methods was performed on an open EEG-fNIRS dataset. We found the proposed method can yield superior performance (mean accuracy of 99.641 % in 5-fold cross validation of an intra-subject experiment). This work provides a new option for multi-modal MI decoding, which can be applied in the rehabilitation field based on hybrid BCI systems.",

    "abstract": "Accurate decoding finger motor imagery is essential for fine motor control using EEG signals. However, decoding finger motor imagery is particularly challenging compared with ordinary motor imagery. This paper proposed a novel EEG decoding method of feature-dependent frequency band selection, feature fusion, and ensemble learning (DSFE) for finger motor imagery. First, a feature-dependent frequency band selection method based on correlation coefficient (FDCC) was proposed to select feature-specific effective bands. Second, a feature fusion method was proposed to fuse different types of candidate features to produce multiple refined sets of decoding features. Finally, an ensemble model using the weighted voting strategy was proposed to make full use of these diverse sets of final features. The results on a public EEG dataset of five fingers motor imagery showed that the DSFE method is effective and achieves the highest decoding accuracy of 50.64%, which is 7.64% higher than existing studies using exactly the same data. The experiments further revealed that both the effective frequency bands of different subjects and the effective frequency bands of different types of features are different in finger motor imagery. Furthermore, compared with two-hand motor imagery, the effective decoding information of finger motor imagery is transferred to the lower frequency. The idea and findings in this paper provide a valuable perspective for understanding fine motor imagery in-depth.",

To avoid the great individual difference of the motor imagery ability, object-oriented motor imagery was applied, and the effects were studied. Kinesthetic motor imagery and visual observation were administered to 15 healthy volunteers. The EEG during cue-based simple imagery (SI), object-oriented motor imagery (OI), non-object-oriented motor imagery (NI) and visual observation (VO) was recorded. Study results showed that OI and NI presented significant contralateral suppression in mu rhythm (p < 0.05). Besides, OI exhibited significant contralateral suppression in beta rhythm (p < 0.05). While no significant mu or beta contralateral suppression could be found during VO or SI (p > 0.05). Compared with NI, OI showed significant difference (p < 0.05) in mu rhythm and weak significant difference (p = 0.0612) in beta rhythm over the contralateral hemisphere. The ability of motor imagery can be reflected by the suppression degree of mu and beta frequencies which are the motor related rhythms. Thus, greater enhancement of activation in mirror neuron system is involved in response to object-oriented motor imagery. The object-oriented motor imagery is favorable for improvement of motor imagery ability.",

While much progress has been made in terms of BCI motor control, significantly less attention has been given to the restoration of tactile, or cutaneous sensations, which can be very important during grasping or manipulation of objects. BCIs will need to integrate both the motor and sensory modalities to truly restore arm and hand function. Here we describe a bidirectional BCI, a system which translates neural signals recorded from the motor cortex into signals to control a device and provides somatosensory feedback by translating external sensor information to electric stimulation patterns delivered to the cortex. In this chapter, we review the neuroscience of somatosensation, the history of sensory feedback in BCI applications, specifically for restoration of hand function and cutaneous sensations, and describe additional work that needs to be completed to make bidirectional BCI a clinical reality.",

A BBI system is made up of two parts known as the brain-computer interface part, which reads a sender's brain activity and digitalizes it, and the computer-brain interface part, which writes the delivered brain activity to a receiving brain. As with other technologies, BBI systems have gone through an evolutionary process since they first appeared. The BBI systems have been employed for numerous purposes, including rehabilitation for post-stroke patients, communicating with patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, locked-in syndrome and speech problems following stroke. Also, it has been proposed that a BBI system could play an important role on future battlefields. This technology was not only employed for communicating between two human brains but also for making a direct communication path among different species through which motor or sensory commands could be sent and received. However, the application of BBI systems has provoked significant challenges to human rights principles due to their ability to access and manipulate human brain information. In this study, we aimed to review the brain-computer interface and computer-brain interface technologies as components of BBI systems, the development of BBI systems, applications of this technology, arising ethical issues and expectations for future use.",

One of the new and useful technologies to estimate MWL is the Brain computer interface (BCI) based on EEG signals, which is regarded as the gold standard of cognitive status. However, estimation systems involving handcrafted EEG features are time-consuming and unsuitable to apply in real-time. The purpose of this study was to propose an end-to-end BCI framework for MWL estimation. First, a new automated data preprocessing method was proposed to remove the artifact without human interference. Then a new neural network structure named EEG-TNet was designed to extract both the temporal and frequency information from the original EEG. Furthermore, two types of experiments and ablation studies were performed to prove the effectiveness of this model. In the subject-dependent experiment, the estimation accuracy of dual-task estimation (No task vs. TASK) and triple-task estimation (Lo vs. Mi vs. Hi) reached 99.82 and 99.21%, respectively. In contrast, the accuracy of different tasks reached 82.78 and 66.83% in subject-independent experiments. Additionally, the ablation studies proved that preprocessing method and network structure had significant contributions to estimation MWL. The proposed method is convenient without any human intervention and outperforms other related studies, which becomes an effective way to reduce human factor risks.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most common methods used for seizure detection as it records the electrical activity of the brain. Symmetry and asymmetry of EEG signals can be used as indicators of epileptic seizures. Normally, EEG signals are symmetrical in nature, with similar patterns on both sides of the brain. However, during a seizure, there may be a sudden increase in the electrical activity in one hemisphere of the brain, causing asymmetry in the EEG signal. In patients with epilepsy, interictal EEG may show asymmetric spikes or sharp waves, indicating the presence of epileptic activity. Therefore, the detection of symmetry/asymmetry in EEG signals can be used as a useful tool in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy. However, it should be noted that EEG findings should always be interpreted in conjunction with the patient's clinical history and other diagnostic tests. In this paper, we propose an EEG-based improved automatic seizure detection system using a Deep neural network (DNN) and Binary dragonfly algorithm (BDFA). The DNN model learns the characteristics of the EEG signals through nine different statistical and Hjorth parameters extracted from various levels of decomposed signals obtained by using the Stationary Wavelet Transform. Next, the extracted features were reduced using the BDFA which helps to train DNN faster and improve its performance. The results show that the extracted features help to differentiate the normal, interictal, and ictal signals effectively with 100% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score with a 13% selected feature subset when compared to the existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in brain activity hinder the online application of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space. Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9% on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery. These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.",

    "abstract": "In brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and P300 responses have achieved widespread implementation owing to their superior information transfer rates (ITR) and minimal training requirements. These neurophysiological signals have exhibited robust efficacy and versatility in external device control, demonstrating enhanced precision and scalability. However, conventional implementations predominantly utilise liquid crystal display (LCD)-based visual stimulation paradigms, which present limitations in practical deployment scenarios. This investigation presents the development and evaluation of a novel light-emitting diode (LED)-based dual stimulation apparatus designed to enhance SSVEP classification accuracy through the integration of both SSVEP and P300 paradigms. The system employs four distinct frequencies, 7 Hz, 8 Hz, 9 Hz, and 10 Hz, corresponding to forward, backward, right, and left directional controls, respectively. Oscilloscopic verification confirmed the precision of these stimulation frequencies. Real-time feature extraction was accomplished through the concurrent analysis of maximum Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) amplitude and P300 peak detection to ascertain user intent. Directional control was determined by the frequency exhibiting maximal amplitude characteristics. The visual stimulation hardware demonstrated minimal frequency deviation, with error differentials ranging from 0.15%to 0.20%across all frequencies. The implemented signal processing algorithm successfully discriminated all four stimulus frequencies whilst correlating them with their respective P300 event markers. Classification accuracy was evaluated based on correct task intention recognition. The proposed hybrid system achieved a mean classification accuracy of 86.25%, coupled with an average ITR of 42.08 bits per minute (bpm).",

    "abstract": "Classification models used in brain-computer interface (BCI) are usually designed for a single BCI paradigm. This requires the redevelopment of the model when applying it to a new BCI paradigm, resulting in repeated costs and effort. Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical usage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the above gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a tempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature selec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms and generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature extraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are extracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to form high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The results, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI, SSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%, 80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and macro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models. This study pro-vides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm classifica-tion. It lays a technological foundation for de-veloping a new generation of unified decoding systems, paving the way for low-cost and universal practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential is a brain response to visual stimuli flickering at constant frequencies. It is commonly used in brain-computer interfaces for direct brain-device communication due to their simplicity, minimal training data, and high information transfer rate. Traditional methods suffer from poor performance due to reliance on prior knowledge, while deep learning achieves higher accuracy but requires substantial high-quality training data for precise signal decoding. In this paper, we propose a calibration-free EEG signal decoding framework for fast SSVEP detection. Our framework integrates Inter-Trial Remixing & Context-Aware Distribution Alignment data augmentation for EEG signals and employs a compact architecture of small fully connected layers, effectively addressing the challenge of limited EEG data availability. Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Spectrum Denoise Module that operates in the frequency domain based on global features, requiring only linear complexity to reduce noise in EEG data and improve data quality. For calibration-free classification experiments on short EEG signals from three public datasets, our framework demonstrates statistically significant accuracy advantages(p<0.05) over existing methods in the majority of cases, while requiring at least 52.7% fewer parameters and 29.9% less inference time. By eliminating the need for user-specific calibration, this advancement significantly enhances the usability of BCI systems, accelerating their commercialization and widespread adoption in real-world applications.",

However, common brain-computer interfaces often employ one-step strategy that rely on non-natural paradigms, such as SSVEP-BCI and MI-BCI, are limited to specific scenarios, restricting their broader application. This paper first proposes a two-step strategic brain-muscular-hand interface (BMHI) based on biological evolutionary selection mechanism, by integrating the brain-muscle (BM) interface with the muscle-hand (MH) interface through crosstalk (\"BMHI = BM + MH\"). To verify the effectiveness of BMHI and the advantages of a two-step strategy inspired by natural evolution, we conducted offline, comparison (comparing BMHI (two-step) and brain-hand interface (one-step)), and online experiments (using BMHI to control a virtual/machine hand for daily tasks). The results show that: (1) BMHI is feasible and the prediction accuracy is 0.79; (2) Unlike traditional multi-layer neural networks that attempt to establish a direct brain-signal-to-action mapping through a single end-to-end process (brain-hand interface), BMHI incorporates the neuro-muscular transmission mechanisms evolved in biological systems as an intermediate constraint layer. This phased decoding strategy can reduce training time by approximately 18-fold and improve decoding accuracy; (3) In the online control experiment, both the virtual hand and the manipulator were able to successfully complete tasks, like moving objects such as boxes or plates and holding water glasses. The results show that BMHI adopts a two-step decoding strategy that mimics natural human neural motor pathways, improves training efficiency and prediction accuracy, and promotes the development of BCI technology to a more natural interaction mode.",

Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.",

The widespread adoption of BCIs in daily application scenarios is still limited by factors such as their single functionality, restricted paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low levels of intelligence. In this paper, we propose an innovative BCI system that deeply integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with an LLM application programming interface (API). It allows natural language input through the SSVEP speller and dynamically calls large models to generate SSVEP paradigms. The command prompt, blinking frequency, and layout position are adjustable to meet the user's control requirements in various scenarios. More than ten languages are compatible with the multilingual support of LLM. A variety of task scenarios, such as home appliance control, robotic arm operation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) management are provided. The task interfaces of the system can be personalized according to the user's habits, usage scenarios, and equipment characteristics. By combining the SSVEP speller with an LLM, the system solves numerous challenges faced by current BCI systems and makes breakthroughs in functionality, intelligence, and multilingual support. The introduction of LLM not only enhances user experience but also expands the potential applications of BCI technology in real-world environments.",

However, deep neural networks for SSVEP spellers often suffer from low accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen subjects, largely due to the high variability in EEG data.

Using the Benchmark dataset from Tsinghua University, we explore various data augmentation techniques, including frequency masking, time masking, and noise injection, to improve the robustness of deep learning models. Additionally, we integrate a language model (CharRNN) with EEGNet to incorporate linguistic context, significantly enhancing word-level decoding accuracy. Our results demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to 2.9 percent over the baseline, with time masking and language modeling showing the most promise.

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) has significantly influenced the domain of human-computer interaction, with Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) emerging as a notably robust paradigm. This study explores advanced classification techniques leveraging interpretable fuzzy transfer learning (iFuzzyTL) to enhance the adaptability and performance of SSVEP-based systems. Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification. However, these methods often require complex tuning and extensive data, limiting immediate applicability. iFuzzyTL introduces an adaptive framework that combines fuzzy logic principles with neural network architectures, focusing on efficient knowledge transfer and domain adaptation. iFuzzyTL refines input signal processing and classification in a human-interpretable format by integrating fuzzy inference systems and attention mechanisms. This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model's efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance.",

    "abstract": "The defeat of the central motor neuron leads to the motor disorders. Patients lose the ability to control voluntary muscles, for example, of the upper limbs, which introduces a fundamental dissonance in the possibility of daily use of a computer or smartphone. As a result, the patients lose the ability to communicate with other people. The article presents the most popular paradigms used in the brain-computer-interface speller system and designed for typing by people with severe forms of the movement disorders. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a promising technology for individuals with communication impairments. BCI-spellers are systems that enable users to spell words by selecting letters on a computer screen using their brain activity. There are three main types of BCI-spellers: P300, motor imagery (MI), and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). However, each type has its own limitations, which has led to the development of hybrid BCI-spellers that combine the strengths of multiple types. Hybrid BCI-spellers can improve accuracy and reduce the training period required for users to become proficient. Overall, hybrid BCI-spellers have the potential to improve communication for individuals with impairments by combining the strengths of multiple types of BCI-spellers. In conclusion, BCI-spellers are a promising technology for individuals with communication impairments. P300, MI, and SSVEP are the three main types of BCI-spellers, each with their own advantages and limitations. Further research is needed to improve the accuracy and usability of BCI-spellers and to explore their potential applications in other areas such as gaming and virtual reality.",

    "abstract": "Our brain state is affected by and adapted to our surroundings. Therefore, to study natural states of the brain, it is desirable to measure brain responses in natural environments outside the lab. Among functional brain scanning methods, electroencephalography (EEG) is the most promising method for non-invasive brain monitoring in real-life environments. To enable long-term recordings in real-life, EEG devices must be wearable, user-friendly, and discreet. Ear-EEG is a method where EEG signals are recorded from electrodes placed on an earpiece inserted into the ear. The compact and discreet nature of an ear-EEG device makes it suitable for long-term real-life recordings. In this study, 6 subjects were recorded with conventional scalp EEG and ear-EEG. All recordings were performed with the same instrumentation and paradigms in both a lab setting and a real-life setting. The ear-EEG recordings were performed with a previously developed drycontact ear-EEG platform. Signals from the scalp electrodes and ear-electrodes were recorded by the same biosignal recorder, enabling re-referencing in the post-processing and analysis. The study comprised four paradigms: auditory steady-state response (ASSR), steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), auditory onset response, and alpha band modulation. When the data were analyzed with a scalp reference (Cz), all the investigated responses were statistically significant in recordings from both settings. Statistically significant ASSR and SSVEP were measured in the lab by ear-electrodes referenced to an electrode within the same ear. In real-life, only the ASSR was statistically significant for a reference within the same ear. The results demonstrates that electrical brain activity can be recorded from dry-contact electrode ear-EEG in real-life.",

    "abstract": "The present work focuses on how to build a wearable brain-computer interface (BCI). BCIs are a novel means of human-computer interaction that relies on direct measurements of brain signals to assist both people with disabilities and those who are able-bodied. Application examples include robotic control, industrial inspection, and neurorehabilitation. Notably, recent studies have shown that steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are particularly suited for communication and control applications, and efforts are currently being made to bring BCI technology into daily life. To achieve this aim, the final system must rely on wearable, portable, and low-cost instrumentation. In exploiting SSVEPs, a flickering visual stimulus with fixed frequencies is required. Thus, in considering daily-life constraints, the possibility to provide visual stimuli by means of smart glasses was explored in this study. Moreover, to detect the elicited potentials, a commercial device for electroencephalography (EEG) was considered. This consists of a single differential channel with dry electrodes (no conductive gel), thus achieving the utmost wearability and portability. In such a BCI, the user can interact with the smart glasses by merely staring at icons appearing on the display. Upon this simple principle, a user-friendly, low-cost BCI was built by integrating extended reality (XR) glasses with a commercially available EEG device. The functionality of this wearable XR-BCI was examined with an experimental campaign involving 20 subjects. The classification accuracy was between 80%-95% on average depending on the stimulation time. Given these results, the system can be used as a human-machine interface for industrial inspection but also for rehabilitation in ADHD and autism.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) is capable of modulating the neural activity of specific brain regions, with a potential role as a non-invasive computer-to-brain interface (CBI). In conjunction with the use of brain-to-computer interface (BCI) techniques that translate brain function to generate computer commands, we investigated the feasibility of using the FUS-based CBI to non-invasively establish a functional link between the brains of different species (i.e. human and Sprague-Dawley rat), thus creating a brain-to-brain interface (BBI). The implementation was aimed to non-invasively translate the human volunteer's intention to stimulate a rat's brain motor area that is responsible for the tail movement. The volunteer initiated the intention by looking at a strobe light flicker on a computer display, and the degree of synchronization in the electroencephalographic steady-state-visual-evoked-potentials (SSVEP) with respect to the strobe frequency was analyzed using a computer. Increased signal amplitude in the SSVEP, indicating the volunteer's intention, triggered the delivery of a burst-mode FUS (350 kHz ultrasound frequency, tone burst duration of 0.5 ms, pulse repetition frequency of 1 kHz, given for 300 msec duration) to excite the motor area of an anesthetized rat transcranially. The successful excitation subsequently elicited the tail movement, which was detected by a motion sensor. The interface was achieved at 94.0±3.0% accuracy, with a time delay of 1.59±1.07 sec from the thought-initiation to the creation of the tail movement. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a computer-mediated BBI that links central neural functions between two biological entities, which may confer unexplored opportunities in the study of neuroscience with potential implications for therapeutic applications.",

Here, a multi-modal BCI which combines motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is proposed to achieve stable control of a quadcopter in three-dimensional physical space. The complete information common spatial pattern (CICSP) method is used to extract two MI features to control the quadcopter to fly left-forward and right-forward, and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is employed to perform the SSVEP classification for rise and fall. Eye blinking is designed to switch these two modes while hovering. Real-time feedback is provided to subjects by a global camera. Two flight tasks were conducted in physical space in order to certify the reliability of the BCI system. Subjects were asked to control the quadcopter to fly forward along the zig-zag pattern to pass through a gate in the relatively simple task. For the other complex task, the quadcopter was controlled to pass through two gates successively according to an S-shaped route. The performance of the BCI system is quantified using suitable metrics and subjects are able to acquire 86.5% accuracy for the complicated flight task. It is demonstrated that the multi-modal BCI has the ability to increase the accuracy rate, reduce the task burden, and improve the performance of the BCI system in the real world.",

The present study realized a novel hybrid BCI combining high-frequency SSVEP and sEMG signals for spelling applications. EEG and sEMG were obtained simultaneously from the scalp and skin surface of subjects, respectively. These two types of signals were analyzed independently and then combined to determine the target stimulus. Our online results demonstrated that the developed hybrid BCI yielded a mean accuracy of 88.07 ± 1.43% and ITR of 159.12 ± 4.31 bits/min.

Hybridization combining more than two modalities is a new trend in brain imaging and prosthesis control. Electroencephalography (EEG), due to its easy use and fast temporal resolution, is most widely utilized in combination with other brain/non-brain signal acquisition modalities, for instance, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), and eye tracker. Three main purposes of hybridization are to increase the number of control commands, improve classification accuracy and reduce the signal detection time. Currently, such combinations of EEG + fNIRS and EEG + EOG are most commonly employed. Four principal components (i.e., hardware, paradigm, classifiers, and features) relevant to accuracy improvement are discussed. In the case of brain signals, motor imagination/movement tasks are combined with cognitive tasks to increase active brain-computer interface (BCI) accuracy. Active and reactive tasks sometimes are combined: motor imagination with steady-state evoked visual potentials (SSVEP) and motor imagination with P300. In the case of reactive tasks, SSVEP is most widely combined with P300 to increase the number of commands. Passive BCIs, however, are rare. After discussing the hardware and strategies involved in the development of hBCI, the second part examines the approaches used to increase the number of control commands and to enhance classification accuracy. The future prospects and the extension of hBCI in real-time applications for daily life scenarios are provided.",

Motor imagery (MI) based BCI with robotic aided devices has been demonstrated as an effective neural rehabilitation tool to improve post-stroke hand function. It is necessary for a user of MI-BCI to receive a long time training, while the user usually suffers unsuccessful and unsatisfying results in the beginning. To propose another non-invasive BCI paradigm rather than MI-BCI, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) based BCI was proposed as user intension detection to trigger the soft robotic glove for post-stroke hand function rehabilitation. Thirty post-stroke patients with impaired hand function were randomly and equally divided into three groups to receive conventional, robotic, and BCI-robotic therapy in this randomized control trial (RCT). Clinical assessment of Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment of Upper Limb (FMA-UL), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) were performed at pre-training, post-training and three months follow-up. In comparing to other groups, The BCI-robotic group showed significant improvement after training in FMA full score (10.05 ± 8.03, p = 0.001), FMA shoulder/elbow (6.2 ± 5.94, p = 0.0004) and FMA wrist/hand (4.3 ± 2.83, p = 0.007), and WMFT (5.1 ± 5.53, p = 0.037). The improvement of FMA was significantly correlated with BCI accuracy (r = 0.714, p = 0.032). Recovery of hand function after rehabilitation of SSVEP-BCI controlled soft robotic glove showed better result than solely robotic glove rehabilitation, equivalent efficacy as results from previous reported MI-BCI robotic hand rehabilitation. It proved the feasibility of SSVEP-BCI controlled soft robotic glove in post-stroke hand function rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "As a widely used brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm, steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCIs have the advantages of high information transfer rates, high tolerance for artifacts, and robust performance across diverse users. However, the incidence of mental fatigue from prolonged, repetitive stimulation is a critical issue for SSVEP-based BCIs. Music is often used as a convenient, non-invasive means of relieving mental fatigue. This study investigates the compensatory effect of music on mental fatigue through the introduction of different modes of background music in long-duration, SSVEP-BCI tasks. Changes in electroencephalography power index, SSVEP amplitude, and signal-to-noise ratio were used to assess participants' mental fatigue. The study's results show that the introduction of exciting background music to the SSVEP-BCI task was effective in relieving participants' mental fatigue. In addition, for continuous SSVEP-BCI tasks, a combination of musical modes that used soothing background music during the rest interval phase proved more effective in reducing users' mental fatigue. This suggests that background music can provide a practical solution for long-duration SSVEP-based BCI implementation.",

    "abstract": "Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that uses electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to control external devices, such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). Visual BCI paradigms based on P300 and Steady State Visually Evoked potentials (SSVEP) have shown high potential for clinical purposes. Numerous studies have been published on P300- and SSVEP-based non-invasive BCIs, but many of them present two shortcomings: (1) they are not aimed for motor rehabilitation applications, and (2) they do not report in detail the artificial intelligence (AI) methods used for classification, or their performance metrics. To address this gap, in this paper the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology was applied to prepare a systematic literature review (SLR). Papers older than 10 years, repeated or not related to a motor rehabilitation application, were excluded. Of all the studies, 51.02% referred to theoretical analysis of classification algorithms. Of the remaining, 28.48% were for spelling, 12.73% for diverse applications (control of wheelchair or home appliances), and only 7.77% were focused on motor rehabilitation. After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and quality screening was performed, 34 articles were selected. Of them, 26.47% used the P300 and 55.8% the SSVEP signal. Five applications categories were established: Rehabilitation Systems (17.64%), Virtual Reality environments (23.52%), FES (17.64%), Orthosis (29.41%), and Prosthesis (11.76%). Of all the works, only four performed tests with patients. The most reported machine learning (ML) algorithms used for classification were linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (48.64%) and support vector machine (16.21%), while only one study used a deep learning algorithm: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The reported accuracy ranged from 38.02 to 100%, and the Information Transfer Rate from 1.55 to 49.25 bits per minute. While LDA is still the most used AI algorithm, CNN has shown promising results, but due to their high technical implementation requirements, many researchers do not justify its implementation as worthwile. To achieve quick and accurate online BCIs for motor rehabilitation applications, future works on SSVEP-, P300-based and hybrid BCIs should focus on optimizing the visual stimulation module and the training stage of ML and DL algorithms.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been increased interest in using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems; the SSVEP approach currently provides the fastest and most reliable communication paradigm for the implementation of a non-invasive BCI. This paper presents recent developments in the signal processing of the SSVEP-based Bremen BCI system, which allowed one of the subjects in an online experiment to reach a peak information transfer rate (ITR) of 124 bit min(-1). It is worth mentioning that this ITR value is higher than all values previously published in the literature for any kind of BCI paradigm.",

An exploratory and descriptive approach is used in the analysis. Computational tools such as the biblioshiny application for R-Bibliometrix and VOSViewer are employed to generate data on years, sources, authors, affiliation, country, documents, co-author, co-citation, and co-occurrence. This article allows for the identification of different bibliometric indicators such as the research process, evolution, visibility, volume, influence, impact, and production in the field of brain-computer interfaces for MI and SSVEP paradigms in rehabilitation and robotics applications from 2000 to August 2024.",
